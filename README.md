# Repo Analyzer

## Overview

The Repo Analyzer is a tool designed to analyze your project files and generate various outputs, including system diagrams, based on the descriptions of your files. The tool is built with a GUI that allows you to generate a system explorer, analyze Qpid usage, and generate a system diagram.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the environment, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- `pip` (Python package installer)

## Installation

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/repo-analyzer.git
cd repo-analyzer
```

### Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment

It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

- On Windows:

    ```bash
    venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

- On macOS/Linux:

    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

### Step 3: Install Required Dependencies

Install the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you don't have a `requirements.txt`, you can manually install the necessary packages:

```bash
pip install openai tkinter matplotlib networkx
```

### Step 4: Set Up the API Key

Create a file named `apikey.json` in the root directory of your project and add your OpenAI API key:

```json
{
    "key": "your-openai-api-key"
}
```

Replace `"your-openai-api-key"` with your actual API key from OpenAI.

### Step 5: Prepare the `analysis_files` Directory

Ensure that the `analysis_files` directory exists in the root of your project. This directory will be used to store the outputs generated by the tool.

## Running the GUI

### Step 1: Start the GUI

To start the GUI, run the following command from the root directory of your project:

```bash
python gui.py
```

### Step 2: Using the GUI

1. **Generate System Explorer**:
    - Check the "Generate System Explorer" box.
    - Select the functionality groups you want to include in the system explorer.
    - Click "Start" to generate the explorer. The progress will be displayed in the progress bar.

2. **Analyze Qpid Usage**:
    - Check the "Analyze Qpid Usage" box.
    - Click "Start" to begin analyzing the Qpid usage in your project files. The tool will generate a summary of Qpid usage and save it as a JSON file in the `analysis_files` directory.
    - The tool will also generate a system diagram based on the analysis.

3. **View Logs**:
    - The logs and progress updates will be displayed in the scrolled text box at the bottom of the GUI.

4. **Stop Processing**:
    - You can stop the processing at any time by clicking the "Stop" button.

## Project Structure

Here is an overview of the project's structure:

```

├── system_explorer/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── web_page_generator.py         # Generates web pages based on project structure
│   ├── file_utils.py                 # Contains utility functions for file operations
│   └── diagram_generator.py          # Generates system diagrams based on analysis

│
├── gui.py                            # Main GUI script
├── apikey.json                       # File containing your OpenAI API key
├── requirements.txt                  # List of dependencies
└── analysis_files/                   # Directory for storing output files
```

## Additional Notes

- **API Usage**: The tool utilizes the OpenAI API to generate summaries and perform advanced text analysis. Ensure your API key is correctly set up and that you are aware of any API usage limits that may apply.
- **Modularity**: The project is modularized, so you can easily extend or modify individual components (e.g., adding new types of analysis or diagram generation).

## Troubleshooting

- **ModuleNotFoundError**: If you encounter a `ModuleNotFoundError` for any Python package, ensure you've installed all dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- **Tkinter Issues**: If Tkinter is not installed, you might need to install it separately, especially on Linux. You can do so using your package manager (e.g., `sudo apt-get install python3-tk` for Ubuntu).
