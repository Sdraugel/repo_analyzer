                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>The provided code is written in Python and defines a class named `ProcessReceivedDigitalDataRequest`. This class seems to be a part of a larger system, possibly for handling and processing digital data received from some source.

The class has three instance variables: `receivedConfFile`, `workstationID`, and `siteID`. These variables are initialized as `None` in the class constructor (`__init__` method).

The class provides getter and setter methods for each of these instance variables. 

- `getReceivedDataFile` and `setReceivedDataFile` are for getting and setting the `receivedConfFile` variable, which might be a configuration file received along with the digital data.
- `getWorkstationID` and `setWorkstationID` are for getting and setting the `workstationID` variable, which might be an identifier for the workstation where the data is being processed.
- `getSiteID` and `setSiteID` are for getting and setting the `siteID` variable, which might be an identifier for the site from where the data is received or where it's being processed.

The top part of the code is a legal notice and licensing information from Raytheon Company, the developer of this software. It mentions that the software contains export-restricted data and its dissemination to non-U.S. persons requires an export license or other authorization.</p>
