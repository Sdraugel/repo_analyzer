                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This Python script appears to be part of a larger software system developed by Raytheon Company. The code is related to a product called "Hazard_AQA", which seems to be associated with air quality alerts. 

The script starts with a detailed comment section that includes copyright information, export control details, and contractor information. It also mentions that the software was developed under a specific contract with the US Government.

The script then imports a module named "Hazard_AQA_<MultiPil>", along with several standard Python libraries such as string, time, re, os, types, and copy. The "<MultiPil>" part suggests that this is a placeholder and should be replaced with a specific module name when the script is used.

The script defines a class named "TextProduct" that inherits from "Hazard_AQA_<MultiPil>.TextProduct". It makes a deep copy of the parent class's "Definition" attribute and modifies it. The 'displayName' attribute is set to "Hazard_AQA_<MultiPil> (Air Quality Alert)".

There are several commented-out lines of code that seem to be options for further customization of the "Definition" attribute, such as an "easPhrase", a "hazardSamplingThreshold", and options to include an overview headline and section.

The "__init__" method of the class is defined to call the "__init__" method of the parent class, which suggests that it might perform some initialization tasks when an instance of the "TextProduct" class is created.</p>
