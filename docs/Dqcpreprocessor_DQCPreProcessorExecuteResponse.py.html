                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This code is a Python file that defines a class named `DQCPreProcessorExecuteResponse`. This class currently has a constructor method (`__init__`) that doesn't do anything.

The comments at the top of the file indicate that the software was developed and/or modified by Raytheon Company under a specific contract with the US Government. The software contains export-restricted data, meaning its export/transfer/disclosure is restricted by U.S. law. Any dissemination to non-U.S. persons, whether in the United States or abroad, requires an export license or other authorization.

The file appears to be auto-generated against an equivalent DynamicSerialize Java class. The software history comment indicates that it was generated by an engineer named smanoj on January 28, 2019, under ticket number 7699.

The address and contact information for the contractor, Raytheon Company, is also provided. There is a reference to a document called the "AWIPS II Master Rights File" for further licensing information.</p>
