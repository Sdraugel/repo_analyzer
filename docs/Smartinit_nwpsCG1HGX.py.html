                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This code is a Python script that is part of a software developed by Raytheon Company. The software contains export-restricted data and its export/transfer/disclosure is controlled by U.S. law.

The script is a base file that is not intended to be overridden, but it can be subclassed to override behavior. It is related to the Smart Initialization Configuration section of the GFE Online Help.

The script is named "nwpsCG1HGX" and it was created by Joe Maloney on 2016-07-18. It is a Smart Init for the nwpsCG1HGX model.

The script imports everything from two modules: Init and nwpsCG1.

The script defines a class named "nwpsCG1HGXForecaster" which is a subclass of "nwpsCG1Forecaster". The class has an initializer method that calls the initializer of the parent class with two arguments: "nwpsCG1HGX" and "nwpsCG1HGX".

The script also defines a main function that creates an instance of the "nwpsCG1HGXForecaster" class, runs it, and then notifies GFE with 'HGX'.

The main function is called if the script is run as a standalone program.</p>
