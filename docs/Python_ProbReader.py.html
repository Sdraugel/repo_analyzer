                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This Python script, named `ProbReader.py`, is part of a software developed or modified by Raytheon Company. The script is designed to read and process data from a specific type of file, known as an HDF5 file, which is a common format for storing large amounts of numerical data.

The script defines a function `prob_reader(siteId, fDate)`, which takes two arguments: a site ID and a date. This function reads the appropriate thresholds for the given site ID based on the Julian day (represented by `fDate`).

The function `prob_reader` uses several helper functions:

- `_translate_season(season)`: This function translates a season name into a numerical value.
- `_season(jday, row)`: This function determines the season based on the Julian day and a row of data.
- `translateRow(dataset, row)`: This function translates a row of data into a dictionary.

The `prob_reader` function opens an HDF5 file that corresponds to the given site ID and reads data from it. It determines the season for each element in the file, reads data from a specific table in the file, and stores the data in a dictionary. If an error occurs while reading the file, the function logs the error message.

The script also contains import statements for several libraries, including `h5py` for reading HDF5 files, `logging` for logging error messages, and several modules from the `com.raytheon.uf.common.localization` package for handling localization.

The script also includes detailed comments and metadata about the software's development history, licensing information, and export restrictions.</p>
