                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>The provided text is not a code, but rather a header and revision history for a Python script file named "WindRose.py". It provides information about the script's development and modifications.

The header includes legal and contact information for the Raytheon Company, which developed or modified the software under a US government contract. It also mentions export restrictions on the software.

The revision history provides a detailed log of changes made to the script over time, including the date of each revision, the person who made the changes, and a description of what was changed or added. This is useful for tracking the development of the software, understanding the changes made in each version, and troubleshooting any issues that may arise.

The script itself, "WindRose.py", is not included in the provided text. The revisions suggest that it's a software for creating wind rose diagrams, possibly for meteorological data, and it has features related to Google Earth and KML file creation.

The code appears to be part of a larger application, specifically a module for displaying a wind rose, which is a graphical tool used by meteorologists to give a succinct view of how wind speed and direction are typically distributed at a particular location. 

The code includes a class definition for `WindRose` and a few methods that are part of this class. The `WindRose` class has methods for setting wind directions, getting wind configuration from a file, and retrieving data from a file. 

The `get_wind_config` method reads a configuration file and sets various parameters related to the wind plot, such as the number of wind speeds and wind directions, and the colors to be used for different wind speeds.

The `set_wind_dirs` method sets the number of wind directions.

The `get_data` method retrieves data from a file and calls the `get_wind_config` and `wind_stats` methods. It opens a file, reads the data, and then processes the data to generate wind statistics.

The `wind_stats` method calculates wind statistics based on the data retrieved. It takes into account the month, end month, flight category, and other parameters.

The `_periods` function splits event timespan into hourly intervals.

The `_Help` dictionary provides a detailed description of how to use the application, which includes instructions for selecting time, flight category, and other options.

The code also includes a detailed revision history and software history, which provide an overview of the changes that have been made to the code over time.

This code is performing a series of operations on a dataset, likely related to weather data given the variable names. Here is a breakdown of what each part of the code does:

1. `_get(row)`: This function extracts specific keys ('date_time', 'wind_dir', 'wind_spd', 'wdir_type') from a row of data and returns a tuple containing the date_time and a dictionary of the other keys.

2. `_filter(row)`: This function applies a series of conditions to filter the rows of data. It checks if the wind speed and wind direction are filled, if the wind direction type is not 'C', and if the visibility and cloud cover categories are above certain thresholds. If any of these conditions are met, the function returns False, otherwise it returns True.

3. `_process(dt, data)`: This function processes the data based on the wind direction type and wind speed. It calculates a bin for the wind direction and wind speed, and then calculates periods based on the date_time. It then tries to increment a stats array with the calculated values.

4. The main part of the code first checks if `yday1` is less than `yday2`, and based on that it retrieves rows from a table and applies the `_get` and `_filter` functions to them. It then sorts the resulting data by date.

5. It initializes a stats array with zeros and then calculates the difference between the date_times of consecutive data points. For each difference and corresponding data, it checks if a listener has been cancelled, and if not, it processes the data.

6. It sends the first and last year of the data to the listener, and then iterates over each hour, wind direction, and wind speed, sending an array of these values and the corresponding stat to the listener. 

7. Finally, it sends a "done" message to the listener. This code is likely part of a larger system that processes and analyzes weather data, possibly for forecasting or research purposes.</p>
