                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This Python script, named XmlTafConfig.py, is designed to provide the US National Weather Service (NWS) TAF TAC->IWXXM encoder with configurable settings. It was written by Mark Oberfield from NOAA/NWS/OSTI/Meteorological Development Laboratory and was first created on May 15, 2019.

The script begins by defining some versioning information for IWXXM and IWXXM-US, which are standards for exchanging meteorological data. It then defines URIs and URLs for these standards, as well as a URL for the US Code Registry for Meteorological Services.

The script also sets up some configuration related to the NWSI-10-813 Release, including a URL, title, and a boolean variable to indicate whether an insertion is needed.

It defines the URL for the US TAF Code Registry and sets up some configuration for the aerodrome's ARP geo-location, including the dimensions (srsDimension), name (srsName), vertical datum (verticalDatum), and unit of measure for elevation (elevationUOM).

The script then specifies the path to a file containing codes from the WMO Code Registry in RDF/XML format, and defines URLs for various WMO Code Registry tables and entries.

It also sets up some bit masks for weather and cloud amount, and configures whether xlink:title attributes should be displayed in IWXXM XML documents.

The script then sets the preferred language for titles in the documents, and defines titles for different cloud cover amounts.

Finally, it sets up some configuration for the Message Handling System, including the code, subject, addressee, priority, and output directory.</p>
