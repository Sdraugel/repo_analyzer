                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This Python code defines a class named `ServiceBackupJobStatusNotification` which is a subclass of `GfeNotification`. The `GfeNotification` class is imported from the same package as this code file.

The `ServiceBackupJobStatusNotification` class has two instance variables, `name` and `state`. The `name` variable is initialized as `None` and `state` is initialized as `"UNKNOWN"` in the constructor method `__init__`.

The class has two pairs of getter and setter methods. The `getName` and `setName` methods are for getting and setting the value of the `name` variable. The `getState` and `setState` methods are for getting and setting the value of the `state` variable.

There's also a `__str__` method which returns a string representation of the object. This method is called when the print function is used on an object of this class or when the str function is called with an object of this class as an argument.

The comments at the top of the code file indicate that this software was developed or modified by Raytheon Company under a contract with the US Government. The software contains export-restricted data and its export/transfer/disclosure is restricted by U.S. law. The software history shows that the initial creation was on 06/22/2015 by an engineer named randerso.</p>
