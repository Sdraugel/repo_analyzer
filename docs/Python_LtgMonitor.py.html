                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>The provided code is a Python script named `LtgMonitor.py` developed by Raytheon Company. It's a module for monitoring lightning data. The script is part of a larger software system, as indicated by the import statements at the beginning of the script. 

The script contains two classes: `Monitor` and `TSObsDelta`.

The `Monitor` class is a subclass of `MonitorP.Monitor` and it is designed to monitor lightning data for a specific period (10 minutes as defined in the script). It has a method named `__compare` which compares the number of lightning strikes in the last 10 minutes with the forecast data (`taf`). Depending on the number of strikes, it sets the result text to 'No strikes', '1 strike', or '%d strikes'. It also applies some rules to the data and updates the status of the result.

The `TSObsDelta` class is a subclass of `MonitorP.Rule`. It represents a rule that checks if there is thunder but it's not in the TAF (Terminal Aerodrome Forecast). It has a method that checks if the number of strikes is less than a certain number (3 by default). If the number of strikes is greater or equal to this number and 'ts' (thunderstorm) is not in the TAF, it sets a message indicating that thunder is present but not in the TAF.

The script also includes a detailed revision history, contractor information, and U.S. export control and licensing information.</p>
