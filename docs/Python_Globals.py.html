                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This code file is a Python script named "Globals.py". It appears to be a part of a larger software system developed by Raytheon Company for the US Government. The software is subject to U.S. export control laws.

The script is used to define global variables that will be used across the software system. These variables include:

1. `Forecaster`: A string variable that likely holds the name or identifier of the forecaster.
2. `Products`: A list that is used to store the products that are currently being monitored.
3. `DRC`: This could be an object or a variable related to a data request client.
4. `ServerStatus`: A dictionary that probably stores the last 'ALIVE' message time from the server.
5. `Viewers`: A list that likely contains the viewers in the TAF (Terminal Aerodrome Forecast) editor.
6. `Colors`: A list that stores the colors used in the main GUI (Graphical User Interface) alert labels.
7. `EditTag`: A dictionary that stores the colors used in forecast editors to highlight errors.

The file also contains a detailed history of revisions, including who made the changes and when, as well as a brief description of what was changed. This is a common practice in software development to keep track of changes and updates made to the code over time.

The comments at the top and bottom of the file indicate that this is a base file and is not intended to be overridden, suggesting that it provides fundamental functionality for the rest of the software system.</p>
