                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This code is a Python module that imports two classes, ServerMsg and ServerResponse, from the same package. These classes are also added to the `__all__` variable, which defines the public interface of the module. This means that when a client imports this module using a statement like `from module import *`, only the items in `__all__` will be imported.
