                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This Python code is part of a larger software system developed by Raytheon Company. It's a module that provides an interface for interacting with procedures from Java. The procedures are likely part of the larger software system.

The code begins with a series of comments that provide information about the software's development, export restrictions, and history. It also notes that this file is an absolute override file, meaning that a higher priority version of the file will completely replace a lower priority version of the file.

The code then imports several modules, including logging, sys, and Exceptions, along with several custom modules: JUtil, ProcessVariableList, MasterInterface, and UFStatusHandler.

The main class defined in this code is ProcedureInterface, which is a subclass of MasterInterface. The ProcedureInterface class is designed to interact with procedures, which are likely scripts or modules that perform specific tasks within the larger software system.

The ProcedureInterface class has several methods for interacting with these procedures. These methods allow the class to import modules, get information about procedures, add and remove modules, get the names of method arguments, run procedures, get menu names, get variable lists, and reload modules.

The code also includes error handling to log exceptions and handle specific types of errors. For example, if a procedure is canceled, the runProcedure method logs this event and returns None.</p>
