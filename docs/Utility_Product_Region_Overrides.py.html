                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This code file appears to be a template or base file for defining product-specific regional overrides. It is part of a software developed by Raytheon Company under a US Government contract and contains export-restricted data. 

The code starts with a disclaimer and information about the software's origin, followed by a note that it is a base file not intended to be overridden. It also mentions that the software is in the public domain and provided without warranty.

The code then imports several Python modules such as `string`, `time`, `re`, `os`, `types`, and `copy`, as well as `TextRules` and `SampleAnalysis` which could be custom modules.

A dictionary named `Definition` is created, which is likely used to store the regional overrides and additional regional definition settings. There's a note indicating that this line is required and should not be changed.

A class named `<product>_<region>_Overrides` is defined, with a constructor method (`__init__`) that does nothing (it just contains the `pass` statement). This class is likely meant to be extended with methods for specific product and region overrides.

The code includes placeholders (like `<product>`, `<region>`) and comments indicating where to add definitions, methods, and other customizations. It also suggests adding a debug statement at the beginning of each method for troubleshooting purposes.</p>
