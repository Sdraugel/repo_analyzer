                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This is a Python script that appears to be part of a larger software system developed by Raytheon Company. The script is designed to handle serialization and deserialization of a specific type of data object, specifically, `DatabaseID` objects from the `com.raytheon.uf.common.dataplugin.gfe.db.objects` package.

The script begins with a large comment block that provides information about the software's development and export control restrictions. It specifies that the software was developed or modified by Raytheon Company under a specific contract with the US Government. The software contains export-restricted data, and its dissemination to non-U.S. persons requires an export license or other authorization.

The script then defines the `ClassAdapter` variable as a string representing the fully qualified name of the `DatabaseID` class.

Following this, two functions are defined: `serialize` and `deserialize`. 

- The `serialize` function takes two arguments: `context` and `dbId`. It writes the string representation of `dbId` to the `context`.

- The `deserialize` function takes one argument: `context`. It reads a string from the `context`, uses it to construct a new `DatabaseID` object, and returns this new object.

In summary, this script is a utility for converting `DatabaseID` objects to and from a serialized string representation, likely for the purpose of data storage or transmission.</p>
