                    <p>This part of the code file contains a legal notice and four function definitions.

The legal notice indicates that the software was developed and/or modified by Raytheon Company under a specific contract with the US Government. It also states that the software contains export-restricted data and that its export/transfer/disclosure is restricted by U.S. law. The contractor's name, address, and contact number are also provided. There is a reference to a document called "AWIPS II Master Rights File.pdf" for further licensing information.

After the legal notice, there are four simple mathematical functions defined:

1. The `add` function takes two arguments, `left` and `right`, and returns their sum.
2. The `subtract` function takes two arguments, `left` and `right`, and returns the result of subtracting `right` from `left`.
3. The `multiply` function takes two arguments, `left` and `right`, and returns their product.
4. The `divide` function takes two arguments, `left` and `right`, and returns the result of dividing `left` by `right`.

Each of these functions is designed to operate on two numerical inputs.</p>
