                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This Python code file appears to be a part of a larger software package developed by Raytheon Company. It starts with a detailed comment block that includes information about the software's development, export control restrictions, and contractor details. It also mentions a "Master Rights File.pdf" for further licensing information.

The code itself is auto-generated by a tool named PythonFileGenerator. The "__all__" variable is a list that defines the public interface of the module. It specifies which names should be available when a client imports this module using the "from module import *" syntax. 

The names listed in "__all__" appear to be classes or functions related to an "Active Table", which might be a part of a database or data management system. For instance, there are classes for ActiveTableKey, ActiveTableRecord, and ActiveTableMode. There are also classes for various requests and responses, such as DumpActiveTableRequest, DumpActiveTableResponse, GetActiveTableDictRequest, and GetActiveTableDictResponse. 

The final part of the code imports these classes from their respective modules, which are presumably located in the same directory as this file (indicated by the '.' before each module name). This allows the classes to be used elsewhere in the program.</p>
