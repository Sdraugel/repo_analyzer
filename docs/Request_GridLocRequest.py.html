                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This code is a Python file that defines a class named `GridLocRequest`. The class has two attributes: `workstationID` and `siteID`, both of which are initialized as `None` in the constructor method `__init__`.

The class also has getter and setter methods for these two attributes. The getter methods `getWorkstationID` and `getSiteID` return the current values of `workstationID` and `siteID` respectively. The setter methods `setWorkstationID` and `setSiteID` allow you to set the values of `workstationID` and `siteID` respectively.

The top part of the file is a comment block that provides information about the software's development, export control, and licensing. It states that the software was developed or modified by Raytheon Company under a specific contract with the U.S. Government. It also contains export control information, stating that the software contains data whose export is restricted by U.S. law. The contractor's name, address, and contact information are provided, and there is a reference to a "Master Rights File.pdf" for further licensing information.

Additionally, there is a comment stating that the file was auto-generated against an equivalent DynamicSerialize Java class, suggesting that this Python code might be a part of a system that also involves Java code.</p>
