                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This Python code file appears to be part of a software developed or modified by Raytheon Company under a contract with the US Government. The software contains export-restricted data, and its export/transfer/disclosure is controlled by US law. The contractor's details are also provided.

The code file is a base file that is not intended to be overridden but can be subclassed to override behavior. It seems to be part of a larger system, possibly a weather forecasting system, as it refers to a 'Smart Initialization Configuration' section of the GFE (Graphical Forecast Editor) Online Help.

The code imports two modules, 'Init' and 'WW3'. 'WW3' might refer to a third-generation wave model, which is used in oceanography to simulate and predict sea state variables.

The code defines a class 'AKwave4Forecaster' that inherits from 'WW3Forecaster'. The 'AKwave4Forecaster' class has an initialization method that calls the initialization method of the 'WW3Forecaster' class with two arguments, "AKwave4" for both.

The 'main' function is defined to create an instance of the 'AKwave4Forecaster' class and run it. This could be the entry point of the program when this file is run as a script.</p>
