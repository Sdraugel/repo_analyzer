                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This is a Python script that appears to be part of a larger software system developed by Raytheon Company for the US Government. The script is subject to US export controls and contains technical data that can't be exported or transferred without proper authorization.

The script itself is a local configuration file (localConfig.py) for a server. It imports everything from another Python module named serverConfig, and then also imports serverConfig itself.

The script then defines a tuple named 'rh' which represents the relative humidity. The tuple contains the following values: the string "RH", a constant SCALAR, the string "%", the string "Relative Humidity", and the numbers 100.0, 0.0, and 0. The meaning of these values would be context-dependent, but they likely represent some kind of metadata about the relative humidity data that this script is designed to work with.

Finally, the script defines a list named 'parms'. This list contains a single tuple, which itself contains a list of the 'rh' tuple and a constant named TC1. Again, the exact meaning of these values would be context-dependent. However, the comment above suggests that this script is designed to add relative humidity data to some kind of forecast and official databases, and that the time constraints for this data will be the 1 hr standard.</p>
