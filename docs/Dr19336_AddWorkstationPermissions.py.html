                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This Python script is designed to add workstation-level permissions to all users for all site level userRoles.xml files.

Here's a breakdown of what the code does:

1. It defines the path to the userRoles.xml files and the workstation permissions that need to be added.

2. It imports necessary modules: `glob` for file pathnames pattern matching, `sys` for system-specific parameters and functions, and `xml.etree.ElementTree` for XML parsing and creating.

3. In the `main()` function, it uses `glob.iglob(USER_ROLES_PATH)` to iterate over all the userRoles.xml files in the specified path.

4. For each file, it parses the XML and gets the root element of the XML document.

5. It checks each permission in `WORKSTATION_PERMISSIONS`. If the permission is not found in the XML file, it adds a new "permission" element with the `id` attribute set to the permission. If the permission is already present, it prints a message indicating that.

6. It then checks each "user" element in the XML. If the "userId" attribute of the user is "ALL", it checks whether the user already has the permission. If not, it adds a new "userPermission" element with the text set to the permission. If the permission is already present, it prints a message indicating that.

7. If any changes were made to the XML (either a new permission was added or a new userPermission was added), it writes the updated XML back to the file.

8. The script is meant to be run as a standalone program, as indicated by the `if __name__ == '__main__':` line at the end. If the script is run directly (not imported as a module), it calls the `main()` function to execute the above steps.</p>
