                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This is a Python script for a tool named "PeriodTool". The tool is designed to work with numerical weather elements, specifically the "Period" element. 

The script imports the numpy library, which is a powerful library for numerical computing in Python. It also imports the SmartScript module, which seems to be a custom module, possibly for handling some specific operations related to the tool.

The main functionality of the tool is defined in the "Tool" class, which inherits from the "SmartScript" class. The class has an "__init__" method for initialization and an "execute" method which is required and called once for each grid. 

The "execute" method takes a parameter "Swell", calculates a new value for "Period" by dividing 100 by the sum of the first element of "Swell" and 10.0, and returns this new value. 

There are also optional methods "preProcessTool" and "postProcessTool" which can be used to perform actions at the beginning and end of the tool's operation, respectively. 

The script also includes comments explaining the use of "self" in Python, and how to handle errors in the tool. 

The script is in the public domain and comes without any warranty or technical support.</p>
