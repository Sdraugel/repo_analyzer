                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This code is a Python script that is part of a software developed or modified by Raytheon Company under a contract with the US Government. The software contains export-restricted data and its dissemination is controlled by U.S. law.

The script imports modules from two other Python files, "Init" and "WW3". It then defines a class called "WNAwave4Forecaster" which is a subclass of "WW3Forecaster" from the "WW3" module. The "WNAwave4Forecaster" class has a constructor method that initializes it with the name "WNAwave4".

The script also defines a main function that creates an instance of the "WNAwave4Forecaster" class and runs it. This suggests that the "WNAwave4Forecaster" class has a "run" method, likely inherited from the "WW3Forecaster" class, which executes some functionality of the class.

The comments in the script suggest that this is a base file that is not intended to be overridden, but can be subclassed to override behavior. This is likely a part of a larger system, possibly for weather forecasting given the names used in the script.</p>
