                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>The code defines a Python class named `DeactivateSiteRequest`. This class is likely used to represent a request to deactivate a site in a larger system. The class has two properties: `siteID` and `plugin`, which are both initialized to `None` in the class constructor (`__init__` method). 

The `siteID` likely represents an identifier for a site in the system, and `plugin` could represent a software add-on or module associated with the site. 

The class provides getter and setter methods for both properties. The getter methods (`getSiteID` and `getPlugin`) return the current value of the properties. The setter methods (`setSiteID` and `setPlugin`) allow the properties to be changed.

The comments at the top of the code provide information about the software's development and licensing. They indicate that the software was developed or modified by Raytheon Company under a specific contract with the US Government. The software contains export-restricted data, and its export or transfer is restricted by US law. The comments also provide contact information for the contractor and refer to a separate document for further licensing information.

Additionally, there's a software history comment section that shows a log entry from 09/10/14, indicating that this specific code was manually created and should not be regenerated.</p>
