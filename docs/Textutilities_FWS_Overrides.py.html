                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This code file appears to be a part of a larger software system developed by Raytheon Company. The software contains export-restricted data and is regulated by U.S. law. The software is also in the public domain, provided without technical support or warranty.

The code defines a Python module that contains a class named `FWS_Overrides`. This class is intended to be used for national specific overrides of the FWS formatter. The class is currently empty, with only an `__init__` method that does nothing (`pass` statement).

The code also includes a placeholder for a method `_method` and an example of how to override a dictionary from `TextRules`. These are commented out and not in use. The `phrase_descriptor_dict` method, if uncommented and used, would modify a dictionary obtained from `TextRules` by changing the value associated with the key `"PoP"` to `"chance of"`.

The file also contains a `Definition` dictionary which is currently empty.

The code file includes a software history section, which documents changes made to the software. The latest change recorded is an upgrade to the GFE FWS formatter by an engineer named vmiddendorf on 03/11/2020.

Finally, the code file includes several comments that provide instructions and information to developers who might work with this code in the future.</p>
