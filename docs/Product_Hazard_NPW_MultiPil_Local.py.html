                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This Python script is a part of a software developed or modified by Raytheon Company. It is a base file that is not intended to be overridden. The software contains export-restricted data, and its export/transfer/disclosure is restricted by U.S. law. 

The file appears to be related to a system named AWIPS II, as it refers to a "Master Rights File.pdf" for further licensing information. AWIPS II is the Advanced Weather Interactive Processing System, a meteorological software package used by the National Weather Service in the United States.

The script is importing a module named `Hazard_NPW_<MultiPil>`, and then creating a new class `TextProduct` that inherits from `Hazard_NPW_<MultiPil>.TextProduct`. It also makes a deep copy of the `Definition` attribute from the imported module and modifies the `displayName` attribute of the `Definition`.

The `TextProduct` class has an `__init__` method, which is a special method in Python classes, known as a constructor. This method is called when an object is created from the class and it allows the class to initialize the attributes of the class.

The commented out lines suggest that there are optional attributes that can be included in the `Definition` such as `easPhrase`, `hazardSamplingThreshold`, and `accurateCities`.

The software history comment suggests that the last update was made on 03/15/2020 by an engineer identified as NFTF for the HazSimp format.</p>
