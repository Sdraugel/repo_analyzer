                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This Python script, named RadLtgMonitor.py, is a part of a software developed by Raytheon Company. It is a module that monitors the probability of lightning based on the data from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP).

The script starts with a detailed header that includes the software's licensing information, the history of revisions, and the change document history. It also includes the author's name and the last update date.

The script imports the logging and time modules, along with Avn, MonitorP, and RadLtgData modules. It then sets up a logger for logging events.

The script defines two classes: Monitor and two subclasses of MonitorP.Rule named TSInTaf and TSNotInTaf.

The Monitor class has a method named __compare which compares the forecasted lightning data with the current time. If the forecast data is missing or outdated, it logs a debug message. Otherwise, it calculates the time range of the forecast and applies certain rules to it. If an IndexError occurs, it sets the status to NIL.

The TSInTaf class checks if there's thunder in the Terminal Aerodrome Forecast (TAF) but the probability from the guidance is low. If so, it sets a message indicating this discrepancy.

The TSNotInTaf class checks if thunder is not forecasted but the probability from the guidance is high. If so, it sets a message indicating this discrepancy.

Both TSInTaf and TSNotInTaf classes inherit from the MonitorP.Rule class and override its method to implement their own logic. They also have a severity level of 3 and can be uniquely identified in the system.

The script is designed to be a base file and is not intended to be overridden.</p>
