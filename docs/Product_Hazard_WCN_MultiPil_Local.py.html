                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This code is a Python script that is part of a software developed or modified by Raytheon Company. The software contains export-restricted data, so it's usage and dissemination are controlled by U.S. law.

The script is named `Hazard_WCN_Local.py` and it appears to be a base file that is not intended to be overridden. It imports a module named `Hazard_WCN_<MultiPil>` along with several standard Python libraries such as `time`, `re`, `os`, `types`, and `copy`.

The script defines a class `TextProduct` that inherits from `Hazard_WCN_<MultiPil>.TextProduct`. The class has a dictionary attribute `Definition` which is a deep copy of the `Definition` attribute from the parent class. The `displayName` key of the `Definition` dictionary is set to "Hazard_WCN_<MultiPil> (Convective Watch)".

There are also some commented out keys in the `Definition` dictionary, which suggests that they are optional configurations that can be used when needed.

The class has an `__init__` method that calls the `__init__` method of the parent class, which suggests that it might be doing some initialization work inherited from the parent class. 

Please note that `<MultiPil>` seems to be a placeholder and would be replaced with some specific value in the actual usage of this code.</p>
