                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This Python script is a part of a larger software developed by Raytheon Company under a contract with the US Government. It contains export-restricted data, meaning its distribution, especially to non-U.S. persons, is controlled by U.S. law.

The script appears to be a module for a weather forecasting application, specifically for the nwpsTrkngCG0LOX model. It imports two modules, Init and nwpsTrkngCG0.

The script defines a class, nwpsTrkngCG0LOXForecaster, which inherits from the nwpsTrkngCG0Forecaster class. This class is initialized with the name "nwpsTrkngCG0LOX". 

The main function creates an instance of the nwpsTrkngCG0LOXForecaster class, runs the forecaster, and then notifies the GFE (Graphical Forecast Editor) with the 'LOX' identifier.

The script is set up to run the main function if it is the main module being run, as indicated by the if __name__ == "__main__": line. 

The comments suggest that this file is a base file that can be subclassed to override behavior, and it is not intended to be overridden itself. It also mentions that it is a part of the Smart Initialization Configuration section of the GFE Online Help.</p>
