                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This code is a Python script that is part of a software developed by Raytheon Company. The software is subject to U.S. export control laws, and the details of the contractor are provided. 

The script is a base file that is not intended to be overridden, but can be subclassed to override behavior. It is a part of the GFE Online Help's Smart Initialization Configuration section. 

The script is specifically for the nwpsTrkngCG0MHX model, as indicated by the comment "Smart Init for nwpsTrkngCG0MHX model". 

The script imports modules from two other Python files: Init and nwpsTrkngCG0. 

The script defines a class named nwpsTrkngCG0MHXForecaster, which is a subclass of nwpsTrkngCG0Forecaster. The class has an initialization method that calls the initialization method of the parent class with two arguments: "nwpsTrkngCG0MHX" and "nwpsTrkngCG0MHX". 

The script also defines a main function that creates an instance of the nwpsTrkngCG0MHXForecaster class, runs the forecaster, and then notifies GFE with the argument 'MHX'. 

Finally, the script checks if it is being run directly (as opposed to being imported as a module), and if so, it calls the main function.</p>
