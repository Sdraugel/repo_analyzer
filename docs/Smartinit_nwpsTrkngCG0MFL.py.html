                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This code is a Python script that is part of a larger software system developed by Raytheon Company. The script is designed to calculate surface weather elements from the nwpsTrkngCG0 model output. 

The first part of the file is a legal disclaimer, stating that the software was developed under a specific contract with the US Government and contains export-restricted data. It also provides the contractor's name and address.

The second part of the file is a comment indicating that this is a base file and is not intended to be overridden. It can be subclassed to override behavior. It also references a guide for creating a new smart initialization.

The third part of the file is a comment indicating that this file is for the Smart Init for the nwpsTrkngCG0MFL model, developed by Joe Maloney in 2016.

The actual code begins with importing two modules, Init and nwpsTrkngCG0. It then defines a class named nwpsTrkngCG0MFLForecaster which inherits from the nwpsTrkngCG0Forecaster class. The class has an initializer method that calls the parent class's initializer with specific parameters.

The main function creates an instance of the nwpsTrkngCG0MFLForecaster class, runs it, and then notifies the GFE with a string 'MFL'. 

The last part of the code checks if this script is the main module being run, and if so, it calls the main function.</p>
