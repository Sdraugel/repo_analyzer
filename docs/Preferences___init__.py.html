                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This code file appears to be a Python module that is part of a larger software package developed and/or modified by Raytheon Company under a contract with the US Government. The file contains export-restricted data, meaning its distribution to non-U.S. persons, whether within the U.S. or abroad, requires an export license or other authorization.

The file is located in a directory that should be included in Python's module search path, as indicated by the comment "Don't remove this file. This file indicates to python that this directory should be included in the module search path."

The "__all__" variable is a list that defines the public interface of the module. It specifies which names should be available when a client imports this module using the "from module import *" syntax. In this case, "configureTextProducts" is the only name that will be imported when a client uses this syntax.

Finally, the comment "This is a base file that is not intended to be overridden" suggests that this file provides some foundational functionality for the software package and should not be modified by other developers.</p>
