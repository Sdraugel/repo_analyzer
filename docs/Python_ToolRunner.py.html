                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This code file appears to be part of a software product developed and/or modified by Raytheon Company under a contract with the US Government. The software contains export-restricted data, and its dissemination to non-U.S. persons, whether in the United States or abroad, requires an export license or other authorization.

The code file provides a function named `process`. This function is designed to run a tool script. It takes three parameters: `script`, `pythonTextEditorToolCallback`, and `args`. 

The `script` parameter is expected to be the name of a Python module. The function imports this module using the `__import__` function. 

The `pythonTextEditorToolCallback` parameter is likely a callback function that is used by the tool script.

The `args` parameter is likely a list or a set of arguments that the tool script requires.

The `process` function then retrieves a class from the imported module. The name of the class is expected to be the same as the name of the module. 

An instance of the retrieved class is created and its `process` method is called with `pythonTextEditorToolCallback` and `args` as parameters. The result of this method call is then returned by the `process` function.

The code file also contains a software history comment that indicates the initial creation of the file was done by an engineer named rjpeter on 08/13/09.

Finally, there's a note indicating that this is a base file and it's not intended to be overridden. This suggests that the `process` function it provides is a fundamental part of the software's functionality and should not be modified.</p>
