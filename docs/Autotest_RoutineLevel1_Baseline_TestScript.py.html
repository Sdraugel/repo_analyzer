                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This code file appears to be a part of a larger software system developed and/or modified by Raytheon Company under a contract with the US Government. The software contains export-restricted data, and its dissemination to non-US persons, whether in the US or abroad, requires an export license or other authorization.

The contractor's details are provided, including the name (Raytheon Company), address, and contact number. There is also a reference to a file named "Master Rights File.pdf" for further licensing information.

The software is stated to be in the public domain, furnished "as is", without technical support, and with no warranty, express or implied, as to its usefulness for any purpose. This part of the software is referred to as the "Routine Products Baseline version".

The actual code in this file is relatively simple. It imports a module named `RoutineLevel1_TestScript` and defines a function named `testScript`. This function takes two arguments, `self` and `dataMgr`, and it calls the `testScript` function from the imported module with `self`, `dataMgr`, and the string "Baseline" as arguments. The result of this call is then returned by the function. This suggests that the function is used to run a test script on some data, possibly as part of a testing or validation process for the software.</p>
