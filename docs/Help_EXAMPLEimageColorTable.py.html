                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This is a Python script that appears to be part of a larger software system developed by Raytheon Company. The initial comments indicate that the software is subject to U.S. export control laws, and its dissemination is restricted.

The script seems to be configuring a weather-related image, likely for a graphical forecast editor (GFE) given the import statements. The GFE is a component of the Advanced Weather Interactive Processing System (AWIPS), a meteorological display and analysis package.

Here's a breakdown of what the code does:

1. It imports all the modules from `gfeConfig`, which is likely a configuration file for the GFE.

2. It defines the weather element to display as 'T_SFC:_Official -1', where 'T' likely represents temperature at the surface level. This is assigned to the `Png_parms` variable.

3. It sets `Png_image` to 'T', which means that the image to be created will represent temperature.

4. It sets the default color table for the temperature image to 'Gridded Data', which is likely a predefined color scheme.

5. It sets the maximum and minimum values for the color table to 50.0 and 0.0 respectively. This means that the color scale for the temperature image will range from 0 to 50 degrees.

6. It sets a logarithmic factor for the temperature scale instead of a linear one. This could be used to emphasize differences in temperature at the lower end of the scale.

The script is likely used to generate a temperature map as part of a weather forecast.</p>
