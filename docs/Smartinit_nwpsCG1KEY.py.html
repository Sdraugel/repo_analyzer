                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This code is a Python script that is part of a larger software system developed by Raytheon Company. The script is designed to calculate surface weather elements from the nwpsCG1 model output. The script is not intended to be overridden but can be subclassed to change its behavior.

The script begins with a series of comments that provide information about the software's development, licensing, and export restrictions. It also provides information about the contractor, Raytheon Company, and references a Master Rights File for additional licensing information.

The script then imports two modules, Init and nwpsCG1. 

The main part of the script is a class definition for `nwpsCG1KEYForecaster`, which is a subclass of `nwpsCG1Forecaster` from the nwpsCG1 module. The class has an `__init__` method that initializes an instance of the class with the name "nwpsCG1KEY".

The script also defines a `main` function, which creates an instance of the `nwpsCG1KEYForecaster` class, runs the forecaster, and then notifies the GFE (presumably a part of the larger system) with the key 'KEY'.

Finally, the script includes a conditional that checks if the script is being run directly (as opposed to being imported as a module). If the script is being run directly, it calls the `main` function.</p>
