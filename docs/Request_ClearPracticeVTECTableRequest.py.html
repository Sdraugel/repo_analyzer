                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This Python code defines a class named `ClearPracticeVTECTableRequest`. This class is likely used for creating objects that represent a request to clear a specific table in a system. The table to be cleared is probably identified by a combination of `siteID` and `workstationID`.

The class has two instance variables, `siteID` and `workstationID`, both of which are initialized as `None` in the `__init__` method (the constructor of the class).

The class also provides getter and setter methods for these two instance variables:

- `getSiteID` and `setSiteID` for manipulating `siteID`.
- `getWorkstationID` and `setWorkstationID` for manipulating `workstationID`.

The comment at the top of the code indicates that this file is auto-generated against an equivalent DynamicSerialize Java class. This suggests that there is a corresponding Java class with similar functionality, and this Python class is likely used for interoperability with that Java class.

The large comment block at the top of the file is a legal notice from Raytheon Company, the creator of the software. It includes information about export control restrictions, the contractor's name and address, and a reference to a master rights file for further licensing information.</p>
