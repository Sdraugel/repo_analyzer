                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This code is a configuration file for a software product developed by Raytheon Company. It appears to be for a storm surge threat tool, which generates images representing the threat level of storm surges. 

The code includes various settings and parameters for the generation of these images, such as:

- The image size (Png_width)
- The name of the element displayed as an image (Png_image)
- Parameters for the image (Png_parms)
- Settings for the image's appearance, such as color tables and map backgrounds
- Settings for the image's legend, including whether it's visible and whether it displays time in UTC or local time
- The filename prefix for the generated image files (Png_filenamePrefix)

It also includes some metadata about the software, such as the authors and the history of changes made to the software. 

The code also mentions that it is in the public domain and is provided "as is", without any warranty or technical support. It also states that the software contains export-restricted data, and its export/transfer/disclosure is restricted by U.S. law.</p>
