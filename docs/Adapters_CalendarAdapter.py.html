                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This Python code is part of a software developed or modified by Raytheon Company under a contract with the US Government. The software contains export-restricted data, and its export or transfer is subject to U.S. law.

The code file provides an adapter for the `java.util.Calendar` class. An adapter in this context is a piece of code that allows two incompatible interfaces to work together. In this case, it allows Python code to interact with the `java.util.Calendar` class, which is a part of Java's standard library.

The adapter includes two functions: `serialize` and `deserialize`.

The `serialize` function takes a `context` and a `calendar` object as arguments. It retrieves the time in milliseconds from the `calendar` object using the `getTimeInMillis` method and writes this value to the `context` using the `writeI64` method.

The `deserialize` function also takes a `context` as an argument. It creates a new `Calendar` object, sets the time in milliseconds by reading a value from the `context` using the `readI64` method, and then returns the `Calendar` object.

The `context` in both functions is likely an object that represents a stream of data being written to or read from. The `writeI64` and `readI64` methods are probably used to write and read 64-bit integer values to and from this stream.

The software history comments indicate that this code was initially created on 09/29/10 by an engineer named wldougher.</p>
