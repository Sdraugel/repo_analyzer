                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This code is a script for a software developed by Raytheon Company. It is a tool used to perform a specific operation on a set of data, specifically to sum into the active element the grids defined by varDict["Element"]. This tool is designed to be called by a procedure and generally only for a snow or qpf grid.

The script starts with a copyright notice and a warning about U.S. export control laws. It also provides information about the contractor who developed the software, and a reference to a document for further licensing information.

The script then declares that it is in the public domain, and it is provided "as is", without any warranty or technical support. It also provides information about the author of the script, and the date and version of the script.

The script then declares that it is an absolute override file, meaning that a higher priority version of the file will completely replace a lower priority version of the file.

The script then sets the tool type to "numeric" and the weather element edited to "variableElement". It then imports the numpy library, which provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

The script then sets up a class called "Tool", which inherits from the "SmartScript" class. The class has a constructor that initializes the parent class, and a method called "execute" that sums a grid into the current element. The method checks if varDict is None or if "Element" is not in varDict, and if so, it raises an error. Otherwise, it gets the grids for the specified element and returns the sum.</p>
