                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This part of the file appears to be a combination of a legal notice and some Python code.

The legal notice at the top of the file indicates that the software was developed and/or modified by Raytheon Company under a specific contract with the US Government. It also mentions that the software contains export-restricted data and its export/transfer/disclosure is restricted by U.S. law. It provides the contractor's name, address, and contact information. It also refers to a document called the "AWIPS II Master Rights File" for further licensing information.

The Python code at the bottom of the file is an auto-generated file by PythonFileGenerator. The `__all__` variable is a list that defines the public interface of the module. It specifies which names should be available when the module is imported with a wildcard (from module import *). In this case, 'request' and 'response' are the names that will be imported when this module is imported using a wildcard.</p>
