                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This code file appears to be a Python module that is part of a larger software developed or modified by Raytheon Company under a U.S. government contract. The software contains export-restricted data, and its export or transfer is subject to U.S. law. The contractor's details are provided, and further licensing information can be found in the AWIPS II Master Rights File.

The Python module is intended to serve as a base file that should not be overridden, but it can be subclassed to modify behavior. It is specifically mentioned that this file is related to the Smart Initialization Configuration section of the GFE Online Help, suggesting it's part of a larger system or application.

The main purpose of the module is to provide a set of global parameters for the `Forecaster.run()` method in the `Init.py` file. This is described as a necessary workaround because the global variables could not be instantiated through jep or directly within `Init.py`.

The software history indicates that the initial creation of this module was done by an engineer named dgilling on 09/29/10.

Finally, the code initializes an empty dictionary named `params`. This dictionary is likely intended to be filled with the global parameters mentioned earlier.</p>
