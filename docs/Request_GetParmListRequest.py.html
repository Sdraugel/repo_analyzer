                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This Python code defines a class named `GetParmListRequest`. This class seems to be a representation of a request to get a list of parameters from a database or a similar data source.

The class has three attributes: `dbIds`, `workstationID`, and `siteID`. All of these attributes are initialized as `None` in the constructor method `__init__`.

The class also provides getter and setter methods for each of these attributes. 

- The `getDbIds` and `setDbIds` methods are used to get and set the value of `dbIds`, respectively.
- The `getWorkstationID` and `setWorkstationID` methods are used to get and set the value of `workstationID`, respectively.
- The `getSiteID` and `setSiteID` methods are used to get and set the value of `siteID`, respectively.

The initial comment block at the top of the code provides information about the software's development, contract details, and export control restrictions. It mentions that the software was developed or modified by Raytheon Company and contains export-restricted data. The address and contact number of the contractor (Raytheon Company) are also provided. It also refers to a "Master Rights File.pdf" for further licensing information.</p>
