                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>The provided code defines a Python class named `ResponseMessageValidate`. This class is used to represent a response message that is validated. The class has five attributes: `result`, `message`, `fileType`, `dataURI`, and `validTime`. All these attributes are initialized as `None` in the `__init__` method, which is the constructor of the class.

The class also includes getter and setter methods for each of these attributes. These methods are used to retrieve (get) and modify (set) the values of the attributes. 

Here's a brief description of each attribute:

1. `result`: This could be used to store the result of a validation process.
2. `message`: This could be used to store a message related to the validation process.
3. `fileType`: This could be used to store the type of a file that is being validated.
4. `dataURI`: This could be used to store the URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) of the data that is being validated.
5. `validTime`: This could be used to store the time at which the validation was performed or is valid until.

The comment at the top suggests that this Python class was auto-generated from an equivalent Java class used for serialization and deserialization of objects, likely for the purpose of communication or storage.</p>
