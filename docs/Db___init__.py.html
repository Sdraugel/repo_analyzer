                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This is a Python file that appears to be auto-generated by a tool called PythonFileGenerator. 

The first part of the file is a comment block that provides information about the software's development and legal restrictions. It states that the software was developed and/or modified by Raytheon Company under a specific contract with the US Government. It also mentions that the software contains export-restricted data, which means it cannot be exported/transferred/disclosed without proper authorization under U.S. law. The contractor's name, address, and contact information are also provided. 

The comment block also refers to a file called "Master Rights File.pdf" for further licensing information, which likely contains more detailed information about the rights and restrictions associated with this software.

The actual code in this file is minimal. It defines a variable called `__all__`, which is a list containing a single string: 'objects'. In Python, `__all__` is a special variable that defines the public interface of a module. It dictates which attributes of the module should be exported when a client imports it using the `from module import *` syntax. In this case, only the 'objects' attribute will be imported when this module is imported in that manner.</p>
