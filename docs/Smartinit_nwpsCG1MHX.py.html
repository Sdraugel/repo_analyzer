                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This Python script is a part of a software developed by Raytheon Company under a contract with the US Government. The software contains export-restricted data and cannot be disseminated to non-US persons without proper authorization.

The script provides a module that calculates surface weather elements from the nwpsCG1 model output. The module is defined in a class `nwpsCG1MHXForecaster` which inherits from the `nwpsCG1Forecaster` class. 

The `nwpsCG1MHXForecaster` class has an initializer method (`__init__`) that calls the initializer of the parent class with specific parameters. 

The `main` function creates an instance of the `nwpsCG1MHXForecaster` class, runs the forecaster, and then notifies the GFE with 'MHX'. 

The script is designed to be run as a standalone program. If it is run as a standalone program (i.e., not imported as a module), the `main` function is called.

The comments at the top of the script indicate that this is a base file that is not intended to be overridden, but can be subclassed to override behavior. There's also a reference to a 'smart init' which suggests that this script is part of a larger system that uses a specific initialization pattern.</p>
