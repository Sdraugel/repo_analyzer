                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This Python script is part of a software developed by Raytheon Company. It begins with a legal notice about the software's export restrictions and provides the company's contact information.

The script is a base file that is not intended to be overridden but can be subclassed to change its behavior. It is used for smart initialization configuration, as mentioned in the GFE Online Help.

The script is named 'nwpsTrkngCG0GUM' and was created by Joe Maloney on 2016-07-08. It is a smart initialization for the 'nwpsTrkngCG0GUM' model.

The script imports everything from two modules: 'Init' and 'nwpsTrkngCG0'.

The script defines a class 'nwpsTrkngCG0GUMForecaster' that inherits from 'nwpsTrkngCG0Forecaster'. The class has an initialization method that calls the initialization method of the parent class with two arguments: "nwpsTrkngCG0GUM" and "nwpsTrkngCG0GUM".

The script also defines a 'main' function that creates an instance of 'nwpsTrkngCG0GUMForecaster', runs the forecaster, and then notifies GFE with the argument 'GUM'.

Finally, the script checks if it is being run as the main module, and if so, it calls the 'main' function. This means that if this script is imported as a module in another script, the 'main' function will not be executed. But if this script is run directly, the 'main' function will be executed.</p>
