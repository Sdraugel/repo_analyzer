                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This Python script is a configuration file for a software called ifpnetCDF. It is used to define and control which data grids are included in the output file. 

The script starts by defining an hour (HR) as 3600 seconds. 

Then, it creates an empty dictionary called SampleDef. 

In this dictionary, it sets a default key that contains a tuple. The first element of the tuple is a list containing a single element, 0*HR (which is 0), representing the base time. 

The second element of the tuple is another list, containing a tuple (-24*HR, 1*HR). This tuple represents the offset from the base time and the interval at which data is sampled. 

In this case, the offset is -24 hours (meaning the data starts 24 hours in the past), and the interval is 1 hour. This means that the software will sample data every hour, starting from 24 hours in the past. 

This configuration is the default for ifpnetCDF when used with ISC traffic. The data is sent from 24 hours in the past to the future in 1-hour intervals.</p>
