                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This code file appears to be a part of a larger software system developed by Raytheon Company. The software contains export-restricted data and is subject to U.S. export control laws.

The main purpose of this file is to define a class `nwpsCG1EKAForecaster` which inherits from the `nwpsCG1Forecaster` class. This class seems to be a part of a weather forecasting system, specifically for the `nwpsCG1EKA` model.

The `nwpsCG1EKAForecaster` class has an initializer method that calls the initializer of its parent class with two parameters, both being "nwpsCG1EKA". 

The `main` function creates an instance of the `nwpsCG1EKAForecaster` class, calls its `run` method, and then calls its `notifyGFE` method with 'EKA' as the argument.

The last two lines of the code check if this file is being run directly (as opposed to being imported as a module), and if so, it calls the `main` function. 

The comments in the code indicate that this file is a base file not intended to be overridden, but it can be subclassed to change its behavior. There's also a reference to a "Smart Initialization Configuration" section in the GFE Online Help, suggesting that this file is part of a system that uses smart initialization.</p>
