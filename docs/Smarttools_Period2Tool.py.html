                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This code file appears to be a script for a tool in a larger software system, possibly related to weather data analysis. The script is written in Python and uses the numpy library for numerical computations. 

The script starts with a legal notice and information about the software's origin and restrictions on its use. It specifies that the software was developed or modified by Raytheon Company under a contract with the US Government. It also mentions that the software contains export-restricted data and its dissemination to non-U.S. persons requires an export license or other authorization.

The script then defines a class named `Tool` that inherits from `SmartScript.SmartScript`. This class has an `__init__` method for initialization and an `execute` method that appears to be the main function of the tool. The `execute` method takes a parameter `Swell2` and calculates a new value for `Period2`. The new value of `Period2` is calculated as 100.0 divided by the sum of the first element of `Swell2` and 10.0. The `execute` method then returns this new value.

The script also contains commented-out sections that provide instructions on how to set up variables to be solicited from the user, how to use optional methods, how to handle errors, and what the `self` keyword refers to in Python. These sections seem to be intended as a guide for other developers who might modify or extend this tool in the future.</p>
