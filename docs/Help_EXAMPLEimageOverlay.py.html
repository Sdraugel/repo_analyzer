                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This is a Python script that appears to be a configuration file for a weather imaging software developed by Raytheon Company. 

The script begins with a comment block that provides information about the software's development, the contractor's details, and export control restrictions. It also mentions a separate file ("Master Rights File.pdf") for further licensing information.

The actual code starts with importing everything (*) from the module `gfeConfig`. It also imports `gfeConfig` itself, which seems redundant as everything from `gfeConfig` has already been imported.

Next, it defines a list `Png_parms` with two strings. These strings seem to represent weather elements (temperature at surface level, and wind at surface level) from an official database for display. The '-1' could possibly represent the most recent or current data.

The variable `Png_image` is set to 'T', which indicates that the temperature should be the image displayed.

Finally, `Wind_spatialGraphicType` is defined as a list containing the string "WindBarb". This suggests that the wind data should be displayed as wind barbs, a common graphical representation of wind speed and direction.</p>
