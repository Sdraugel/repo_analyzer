                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This Python script is part of a larger system developed by Raytheon Company, as indicated by the comments at the top of the script. The script is designed to process received configuration requests using Thrift, a software framework for scalable cross-language services development.

The script begins by importing necessary modules and packages, including system-specific parameters and functions, operating system interfaces, and specific classes from the dynamicserialize package and the awips package.

The main function of the script is defined in the `main()` function. It gets connection parameters from the `getConnectionParams()` function, which retrieves host and port information from environment variables. Then, it tries to create a request using the `createRequest()` function and send it to a server using a Thrift client. If any exception occurs during this process, it prints an error message and exits the program with a status code of 1. If the server response is not okay, it also prints an error message and exits the program with a status code of 1.

The `createRequest()` function creates a `ProcessReceivedConfRequest` object, sets its workstation ID to "receive_configuration", sets its site ID to the seventh command-line argument (converted to uppercase), and sets its received configuration file to the sixth command-line argument. It then returns this object.

The script is executed if it's run as a standalone file, not imported as a module. The execution starts from the `main()` function.</p>
