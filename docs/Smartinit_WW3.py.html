                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This Python code file is a module that calculates surface weather elements from the WW3 (WaveWatch III) model output. The WW3 model is a third-generation ocean wave prediction model developed by the NOAA/NWS/NCEP/MMAB which plays a significant role in both operational wave forecasting and academic research.

The module defines a class `WW3Forecaster` which is a subclass of the `Forecaster` class, imported from the `Init` module. The `WW3Forecaster` class has several methods that calculate different weather elements:

- `calcWaveHeight(self, htsgw_SFC)`: This method calculates wave height from the WW3 model and converts it from meters to feet.

- `calcWindWaveHgt(self, wvhgt_SFC)`: This method calculates wind wave height from the WW3 model and converts it from meters to feet.

- `calcWind(self, wind_SFC)`: This method calculates wind from the WW3 model and converts it from meters/sec to knots. It also handles wind speeds greater than 100 by setting them to 0.

- `calcSwell(self, swell_OSEQD1, swdir_OSEQD1)` and `calcSwell2(self, swell_OSEQD2, swdir_OSEQD2)`: These methods calculate primary and secondary swell from the WW3 model. They use wave height for magnitude as that information is not available.

- `calcPeriod(self, swper_OSEQD1)` and `calcPeriod2(self, swper_OSEQD2)`: These methods calculate primary and secondary period from the WW3 model.

The `main()` function at the end of the script runs the `WW3Forecaster` class.</p>
