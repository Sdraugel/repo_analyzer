                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This Python script is part of a software developed by Raytheon Company for the US Government. It contains export-restricted data and its export/transfer/disclosure is restricted by U.S. law.

The script is a base file and is not intended to be overridden. It is in the public domain, furnished "as is", without technical support, and with no warranty. It is used to produce an Earthquake Warning.

The script imports several modules like CivilEmerg, TextRules, string, time, re, os, types, and copy. It defines a class `TextProduct` that extends from `CivilEmerg.TextProduct`. 

The `TextProduct` class has a `Definition` dictionary that contains details about the product such as its display name, output file, edit areas, product name, WMO code, product pil, Product ID for storing to AWIPS text database, and Product ID for transmitting to AWIPS WAN.

The class has an `__init__` method that calls the `__init__` method of its parent class.

It also has a `_makeProduct` method that takes four parameters: `fcst`, `editArea`, `areaLabel`, and `argDict`. This method appends a message to `fcst` and returns it. The message indicates that it is transmitted at the request of the source.</p>
