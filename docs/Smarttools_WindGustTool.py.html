                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This code is a part of a software developed or modified by Raytheon Company. It is a tool for editing the "WindGust" weather element. The tool is of the "numeric" type and it uses the numpy library for mathematical operations.

The main functionality of this tool is defined in the Tool class, which is a subclass of the SmartScript class. The Tool class has an `__init__` method for initialization and an `execute` method that performs the main operation of the tool.

The `execute` method takes a "Wind" parameter and calculates the "WindGust" by multiplying the "Wind" value by 1.5. The calculated "WindGust" is then returned by the method.

The code also includes commented out sections that provide guidance on how to extend the tool's functionality. For example, there are instructions on how to set up variables to be solicited from the user, how to use optional methods like `preProcessTool` and `postProcessTool`, how to refer to the Tool class instance using "self", and how to handle errors. 

The software is in the public domain and is provided "as is", without any warranty or technical support. It also contains export-restricted data and its export/transfer/disclosure is restricted by U.S. law.</p>
