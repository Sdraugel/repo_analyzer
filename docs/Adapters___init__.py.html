                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This Python code is part of a larger software package developed by Raytheon Company. It appears to be a part of a dynamic serialization system, specifically the `__init__.py` file for the `dynamicserialize.adapters` package.

The code begins with a large comment block providing information about the software's development, export control restrictions, licensing information, and a brief history of software updates.

The main purpose of this code is to manage the registration and discovery of adapter classes for serialization. These adapters are used to convert complex data types into a format that can be easily stored or transmitted, and then convert them back into their original form.

The `__all__` list at the top of the file declares the names of all modules in the package that should be imported when `from dynamicserialize.adapters import *` is used.

The `classAdapterRegistry` dictionary is used to store references to the adapter classes that have been registered.

The `getAdapterRegistry` function discovers and registers all adapter classes in the package. It uses the `pkgutil.iter_modules` function to iterate over all modules in the package's path, adding any new ones to the `__all__` list and registering their adapters.

The `registerAdapters` function is used to import and register the adapter classes from a list of module names. It imports each module, retrieves its `ClassAdapter` attribute (which should be a class or a list of classes), and adds it to the `classAdapterRegistry` dictionary. If a module doesn't have a `ClassAdapter` attribute, it raises a `LookupError`.

Finally, the `getAdapterRegistry` function is called at the end of the file to perform the initial discovery and registration of adapters when the package is imported.</p>
