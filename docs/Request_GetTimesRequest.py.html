                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This Python code defines a class named `GetTimesRequest`. This class appears to be a simple data holder or a data transfer object, which is used to transfer data between software application subsystems. 

The class has two instance variables: `pluginName` and `timeField`, both of which are initialized as `None` in the constructor method `__init__`. 

There are getter and setter methods for these two instance variables. The getter methods `getPluginName` and `getTimeField` return the current values of `pluginName` and `timeField` respectively. The setter methods `setPluginName` and `setTimeField` allow you to set the values of `pluginName` and `timeField` respectively.

The comment at the top of the file indicates that this file was auto-generated against an equivalent DynamicSerialize Java class. This suggests that this Python class is likely part of a system that includes both Python and Java components, and this class is used for data transfer between the two. The file was generated by an engineer named 'pmoyer' on September 16, 2016.</p>
