                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This Python script is part of a software developed by Raytheon Company. It is subject to export restrictions by U.S. law and contains information about the contractor's name and address.

The script is a base file that is not intended to be overridden but can be subclassed to override behavior. It provides guidance on creating a new smart initialization (smart init).

The script is named 'nwpsCG1LCH' and was created by Joe Maloney on 2016-07-18. It is a Smart Init for the nwpsCG1LCH model.

The script imports everything from the 'Init' and 'nwpsCG1' modules. It then defines a class 'nwpsCG1LCHForecaster' that inherits from the 'nwpsCG1Forecaster' class in the 'nwpsCG1' module. The class has an initialization method that calls the initialization method of the parent class with two arguments: "nwpsCG1LCH" and "nwpsCG1LCH".

The script also defines a main function that creates an instance of the 'nwpsCG1LCHForecaster' class, runs the forecaster, and notifies the GFE with 'LCH'. The main function is called if the script is run as the main program.

In summary, this script is used to create, run, and notify a weather forecaster for the nwpsCG1LCH model.</p>
