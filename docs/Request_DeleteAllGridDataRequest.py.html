                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>The provided code is in Python and it seems to be a part of a larger software system developed by Raytheon Company. The initial comments indicate that the software is subject to U.S. export control laws, meaning it contains sensitive information that cannot be shared without proper authorization.

The actual code defines a class named `DeleteAllGridDataRequest`. This class appears to be a simple data holder, also known as a Plain Old Python Object (POPO). It has one attribute, `modelName`, which can be set when an instance of the class is created or later using the `setModelName` method. The `modelName` attribute can be retrieved using the `getModelName` method. 

The comment above the class definition suggests that this Python class is auto-generated to match a corresponding Java class in a system that uses the DynamicSerialize protocol. This protocol is typically used for efficient serialization of data in distributed systems.

In summary, this class is a simple data holder that is used to make a request to delete all grid data associated with a particular model in a distributed system.</p>
