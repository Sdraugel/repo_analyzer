                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This Python code is part of a larger software developed by Raytheon Company under a contract with the US Government. The software contains export-restricted data, and its dissemination requires an export license or other authorization.

The code itself is a base file that is not intended to be overridden. It is related to a software update made on March 15, 2020, for a HazSimp format.

The code defines a Python class named `TextProduct` that inherits from another class `TextProduct` inside the module `Hazard_MWW_<MultiPil>`. The `<MultiPil>` part suggests that this is a placeholder and should be replaced with an actual value when using this code.

The `TextProduct` class has a class variable `Definition` which is a deep copy of the `Definition` variable from the parent class. This means that changes to the `Definition` variable in this class will not affect the `Definition` variable in the parent class.

The `displayName` attribute of the `Definition` dictionary is set to "Hazard_MWW_<MultiPil> (Marine Weather)", suggesting that this software is related to marine weather hazards.

There are two commented-out lines of code that suggest optional features that could be added to the `Definition` dictionary: an EAS phrase to be included in the product header and a hazard sampling threshold.

The `__init__` method is a constructor that initializes instances of the `TextProduct` class. It does this by calling the constructor of the parent class.</p>
