                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This is a Python script that appears to be a part of a larger software system developed by Raytheon Company. The script is primarily concerned with creating a subclass of a class from the `RecreationFcst` module. 

The script begins with a detailed comment block that provides information about the software's development, export restrictions, contractor details, and licensing information. 

The script then imports the `RecreationFcst` module, as well as the `string` and `copy` modules. 

The main part of the script defines a new class `TextProduct` that is a subclass of `RecreationFcst.TextProduct`. This new class inherits all the properties and methods of the `RecreationFcst.TextProduct` class but makes some modifications to the `Definition` dictionary. 

The `Definition` dictionary is deep copied from the parent class to ensure that changes made in this subclass do not affect the parent class. The `displayName` key of the `Definition` dictionary is first set to "None" and then immediately overwritten to "TEST_RecreationFcst". 

The `__init__` method of the new class calls the `__init__` method of the parent class, ensuring that any initialization code in the parent class is executed when an instance of the subclass is created. 

The comment in the code indicates that this script is for local customizations for `RecreationFcst` as a base class, but the author's name is not provided. 

It's also worth noting that the comment block states that the software is in the public domain, furnished "as is", without technical support, and with no warranty, express or implied, as to its usefulness for any purpose.</p>
