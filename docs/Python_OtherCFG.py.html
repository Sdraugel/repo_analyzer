                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>The provided code is a Python script that contains a dictionary named `SiteInfo`. This dictionary stores information about different sites, specifically non-WFO GFE sites, which are likely related to weather forecasting. Each key in the dictionary is a site identifier, and the value is another dictionary that includes details about that site, such as its region, full station ID, the city and state of the weather forecasting office (WFO), and the city and state itself.

The script also includes a software history log, which records changes made to the software over time. For instance, on April 22, 2020, an engineer named 'randerso' added the identifiers 'NHP', 'NHZ', 'HAK', 'HUS', and 'NWC' to the script.

The script also contains a notice at the beginning that the software was developed and/or modified by Raytheon Company under a specific contract with the US Government. It mentions that the software contains export-restricted data and its dissemination to non-U.S. persons requires an export license or other authorization. It also provides the contractor's name and address.

Finally, it mentions that this is an absolute override file, meaning that a higher priority version of the file will completely replace a lower priority version of the file.</p>
