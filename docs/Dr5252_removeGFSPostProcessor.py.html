                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This Python script is used to modify an XML file containing configurations for a system called AWIPS2. Specifically, it removes configurations related to a component called GFSPostProcessor.

The script starts by defining a custom XML parser that preserves comments in the XML file. This is done by extending the XMLTreeBuilder class from the xml.etree.ElementTree module and adding handlers for comments and processing instructions.

The script then checks if the correct number of arguments have been passed. It expects two file names: the input XML file and the output file where the modified XML will be written.

The XML file is parsed and the root element is checked to ensure it is "postProcessedModels". If not, the script exits with an error message.

The script then iterates over all "postProcessedModel" elements in the root. For each "postProcessedModel", it checks all its child elements. If a child element is a "processorName" and its text contains "GFSPostProcessor", it is removed from the "postProcessedModel".

If a "postProcessedModel" ends up having no "processorName" elements (i.e., all its processors were removed), the "postProcessedModel" itself is removed from the root. A comment is then inserted at the same position, indicating that the "postProcessedModel" was removed because its only processor, GFSPostProcessor, is no longer in use.

Finally, the modified XML tree is written to the output file.</p>
