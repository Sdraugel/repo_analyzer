                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This script appears to be a configuration file for generating images, likely for some sort of weather forecasting application. The software was developed by Raytheon Company under a US government contract. The software contains export-restricted data, meaning its dissemination to non-US persons requires an export license or other authorization.

The script imports from a module named `gfeConfig`, which presumably contains some default or site-specific configurations. It then sets several configuration parameters:

- `SELegend_font` is set to 2, which likely makes the legend on the generated images smaller than the default size.
- `Png_width` is set to 350, which probably sets the width of the generated images to 350 units (likely pixels).
- `Png_image` is set to 'MaxT', indicating that the images being generated are for maximum temperature.
- `Png_parms` is set to ['MaxT_SFC:_Fcst -1'], which might specify the parameters used for generating the images.
- `Png_logo` is set to 1, which probably means that a logo should be included in the generated images.
- `Png_logoString` is set to "NWS Timbuktoo", which is likely the text that will be displayed in the logo.

The comments in the script provide some additional context and instructions for these configuration parameters.</p>
