                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This code is part of a software developed by Raytheon Company for the US Government. It is a script that generates a Fire Period Table, which is a table that contains weather-related data that is relevant to fire behavior and fire management.

The table includes the following weather elements: Sky, LAL (Live Fuel Moisture), Relative Humidity, Maximum Temperature, Minimum Temperature, Free Wind, Haines (a measure of the potential for dry, unstable air to contribute to the development of large or erratic wildfires), Transport Wind, and Mixing Height.

The table is generated for specific areas (Edit Areas) that are solicited from the user. The user can set the time range for which the data is generated. The output of the table is saved in a text file named "FirePeriodTable.txt".

The code also includes a definition dictionary that specifies the structure of the table, the variables to be included, the type of data for each variable (e.g., scalar or vector), the calculation method for each variable (e.g., minMax, avg, range2Value), and other settings related to the generation of the table.

The code also includes an example of what the output table might look like. The example shows the data for different areas in Colorado (CO) for a specific time period.</p>
