                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This code is part of a software developed by Raytheon Company. It's a Python script that generates a text product for a Nuclear Power Plant Warning. 

The script begins with a disclaimer, copyright notice, and information about the contractor. It also includes a warning about U.S. export-controlled technical data. 

The script then imports several modules including `CivilEmerg`, `TextRules`, `string`, `time`, `re`, `os`, `types`, and `copy`. 

The main class in this script is `TextProduct`, which inherits from `CivilEmerg.TextProduct`. This class has a dictionary attribute `Definition` which contains several key-value pairs defining the properties of the product like its display name, output file, default edit areas, product name, and various product IDs. 

The `TextProduct` class has an `__init__` method that initializes the class by calling the `__init__` method of the parent class `CivilEmerg.TextProduct`.

The class also has a method `_makeProduct` that takes in several parameters including a forecast, edit area, area label, and argument dictionary. This method appends a message to the forecast and returns it. The message indicates that it is being transmitted at the request of a certain source. 

The script is designed to be in the public domain, furnished "as is", without technical support, and with no warranty, express or implied, as to its usefulness for any purpose.</p>
