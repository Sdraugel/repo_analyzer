                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This code is a Python script that appears to be part of a larger software system developed by Raytheon Company. The script defines a class `VCParm` which seems to be used for handling and manipulating data related to weather forecasting, specifically the probability of precipitation (PoP).

The `VCParm` class has several methods for manipulating and calculating data:

- `splitTR`: This method splits a time range based on overlaps with other time ranges.
- `tcmp`: This method compares two times.
- `getInventory`: This method creates a list of overlapping time ranges between two sets of time ranges.
- `poverlap`: This method calculates the percentage of overlap between two time ranges.
- `calcGrid`: This method calculates a grid based on the provided data.
- `calcHistory`: This method calculates a history based on the provided data.
- `getWEInfo`: This method returns information about the weather event.
- `_containsTR`, `_contains`, `_overlaps`, `_intersect`: These are helper methods used for time range comparisons and calculations.

The script also imports the numpy library and defines several constants at the beginning. 

The comments at the top of the file indicate that this script is part of a larger system, and it seems to be an "absolute override file", meaning that a higher priority version of this file will completely replace a lower priority version. 

The software history comment suggests that this script was initially created in 2011 and it was ported from another system called AWIPS1.</p>
