                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This part of the file is mostly a legal notice and a brief description of the software. 

The legal notice states that the software was developed and/or modified by Raytheon Company under a specific contract with the US Government. It also mentions that the software contains export-restricted data, which means that its export, transfer, or disclosure is restricted by U.S. law. Any dissemination to non-U.S. persons, whether in the United States or abroad, requires an export license or other authorization. The notice also provides the contractor's name and address.

The last part of the notice refers to a document called the "AWIPS II Master Rights File" for further licensing information.

Finally, the brief description states that this file contains library modules for the AWIPS II Command Line Interface Tools package. AWIPS II is a weather forecasting system used by the National Weather Service and other agencies. The Command Line Interface Tools package is likely a set of tools for interacting with this system via a command line interface.</p>
