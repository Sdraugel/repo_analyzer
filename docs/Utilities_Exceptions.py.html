                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This code file appears to be a part of a larger software system developed by Raytheon Company. The file contains legal information about the software, including export control and licensing details. It also provides contact information for the contractor, Raytheon Company.

The main purpose of this code file is to define a custom exception class named `EditActionError`. This class is likely used throughout the software to handle errors that occur during editing actions.

The `EditActionError` class inherits from Python's built-in `Exception` class. It has two private attributes: `__errorType` and `__errorInfo`, which are set during the initialization of an instance of the class.

The class also includes methods to get the values of these attributes (`errorType` and `errorInfo`), and a method to set the value of the `__errorInfo` attribute (`setErrorInfo`).

The comment at the end of the file indicates that this file is an absolute override file, meaning that a higher priority version of the file will completely replace a lower priority version of the file. This could be important for version control and update processes.</p>
