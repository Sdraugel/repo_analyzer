                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This Python code file appears to be part of a larger software system developed and/or modified by Raytheon Company under a contract with the US Government. The software contains export-restricted data, which means it is subject to U.S. export laws and regulations. The dissemination of this software to non-U.S. persons, whether in the United States or abroad, requires an export license or other authorization.

The contractor details are provided, including the name (Raytheon Company), address, and contact number. There is also a reference to a document called "AWIPS II Master Rights File" which likely contains further information about the licensing of the software.

The actual code in this file is minimal. The file appears to have been auto-generated by a tool called PythonFileGenerator. It defines a single public module-level object, 'RegionLookupRequest', which is imported from a local module with the same name. This suggests that the file is part of a larger package and is responsible for exposing the 'RegionLookupRequest' object to other parts of the package.</p>
