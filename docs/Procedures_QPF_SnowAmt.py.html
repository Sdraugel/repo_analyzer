                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This code file appears to be a script for a software developed by Raytheon Company. The software is subject to U.S. export control laws due to the presence of export-restricted data. The software is in the public domain and is provided without any warranty or technical support.

The script is named QPF_SnowAmt.py and was authored by a person named Hansen. It appears to be an absolute override file, which means it will completely replace a lower priority version of the file if a higher priority version exists.

The script defines a menu item named "Edit" and a list of tools, namely "QPF_SmartTool" and "SnowAmt_SmartTool". It also defines a variable list with a single variable named "Vertical Motion Influence" with a scale of 0 to 100.

The script imports a module named SmartScript and defines a class named Procedure that inherits from SmartScript.SmartScript. The Procedure class has an __init__ method that initializes the parent class and an execute method that calls each tool in the ToolList. If an error occurs during the execution of a tool, the execution of the remaining tools is stopped.</p>
