                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This is a Python script for a tool named "MinT_SmartTool". The script is part of a software developed or modified by Raytheon Company under a US Government contract. The script contains export-restricted data and requires an export license or other authorization for dissemination to non-U.S. persons.

The script defines a class "Tool" that inherits from the "SmartScript" class. The "Tool" class has an initialization method "__init__" that calls the parent class's initialization method. 

The "Tool" class also has a method "execute" that takes a parameter "T_MinGrid". This method returns the "T_MinGrid" parameter, which is likely used to assign minimum temperature values from temperature grids within the Active Edit Area over Selected Time.

The script imports everything from the numpy library and the SmartScript module. The script also sets two variables: "ToolType" is set to "numeric" and "WeatherElementEdited" is set to "MinT". 

The script also mentions that it is an absolute override file, meaning that a higher priority version of the file will completely replace a lower priority version of the file. 

The script is in the public domain, furnished "as is", without technical support, and with no warranty, express or implied, as to its usefulness for any purpose.</p>
