                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>The provided code appears to be a part of a larger software system, possibly related to weather forecasting, developed by Raytheon Company under a US Government contract. The software contains export-restricted data, meaning it can't be shared outside the US without proper authorization.

The code itself is written in Python and defines a class named `WNAWAVEForecaster` that inherits from the `GWWForecaster` class, which is imported from the `GWW` module. The `WNAWAVEForecaster` class has a constructor (`__init__` method) that calls the constructor of the parent class with two string parameters: "WNAWAVE" and "WNAWAVE".

The `main` function creates an instance of the `WNAWAVEForecaster` class and calls its `run` method. This function is likely the entry point of the program or a part of it.

The comments suggest that this file is a base file, not intended to be overridden, but it can be subclassed to modify its behavior. This is a common practice in object-oriented programming to extend or customize the functionality of a class. The comments also refer to a configuration guide for further instructions on how to create a new smart initialization.</p>
