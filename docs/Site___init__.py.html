                    <p>The code provided is a combination of a legal disclaimer and some Python code. 

The legal disclaimer is a standard practice in many software products, especially those developed under contract or those that contain sensitive data. It specifies the conditions under which the software can be used, transferred, or disclosed. In this case, the software was developed or modified by Raytheon Company under a contract with the U.S. Government. It contains export-restricted data, meaning that it cannot be disseminated to non-U.S. persons without an export license or other authorization.

The Python code is quite simple. It starts with a comment stating that the file was auto-generated by a tool called PythonFileGenerator. 

Then, there is a line that defines the `__all__` variable. In Python, `__all__` is a list that defines the public interface of a module. It specifies which names should be imported when a client imports a module using the following syntax: `from module import *`. In this case, the `__all__` list contains two names: 'notify' and 'requests'. This means that when this module is imported using `from module import *`, only these two names will be imported.</p>
