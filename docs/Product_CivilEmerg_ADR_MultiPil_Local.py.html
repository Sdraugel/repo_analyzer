                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This Python script is part of a larger software package developed by Raytheon Company, and it appears to be related to the generation of administrative messages for a system called AWIPS II.

The script begins with a legal disclaimer and copyright notice, followed by a brief description of the file's purpose and an acknowledgment of the author, Matt Davis.

The script imports several modules, including CivilEmerg, TextRules, and several standard Python libraries.

The script defines a class `TextProduct` that extends the `TextProduct` class from the `CivilEmerg` module. This class appears to be designed to handle the generation of administrative messages in a specific format. 

The `Definition` dictionary within the class contains several key-value pairs that define various aspects of the product, such as its name, ID, and output file location. 

The `__init__` method is the constructor for the class, which initializes the class by calling the constructor of the parent `TextProduct` class from the `CivilEmerg` module.

The `_makeProduct` method appears to be responsible for creating the actual text of the administrative message. It takes several arguments, including a forecast (`fcst`), an edit area (`editArea`), an area label (`areaLabel`), and an argument dictionary (`argDict`). The method concatenates a string to the `fcst` argument and returns the result. The string indicates that the message is transmitted at the request of a certain source. 

Overall, this script seems to be a part of a larger system for generating and managing administrative messages, possibly related to weather forecasting given the mention of a forecast in the `_makeProduct` method.</p>
