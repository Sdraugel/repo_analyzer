                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This piece of code is a Python module that imports two classes, `Lock` and `LockTable`, from the same package. 

The initial block of comments is a legal disclaimer and copyright notice from Raytheon Company, indicating that the software was developed and/or modified by them under a specific contract with the U.S. government. It also includes export control information, stating that the software contains data that is restricted by U.S. law and cannot be exported/transferred/disclosed without an export license or other authorization.

The `__all__` variable is a list that defines the public interface of the module. When the module is imported using the statement `from module import *`, only the names listed in `__all__` are imported. In this case, `Lock` and `LockTable` are the names that would be imported.

The last two lines import the `Lock` and `LockTable` classes from the current package (indicated by the dot before the class names). These classes are presumably defined in other Python files in the same directory as this one.</p>
