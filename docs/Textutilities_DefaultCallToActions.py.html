                <h2>DefaultCallToActions.py</h2>
                <div class="description">
                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This code file is a Python script that appears to be part of a larger software system developed by Raytheon Company. It is named `DefaultCallToActions.py` and it contains a class `CallToActions` which is used to handle "call to action" statements based on the VTEC (Volatile-Timing-Extent-Code) phen/sig code.

The `CallToActions` class has several methods:

1. `pydevDebug`: This method is used for debugging purposes. It imports the `pydevd` module and sets a trace for debugging.

2. `defaultCTA`: This method takes a phen/sig code as an argument and returns the default call to action for that code. If the code is not found in the dictionary, it returns an empty string.

3. `allCTAs`: This method takes a phen/sig code as an argument and returns all call to action statements for that code. If the code is not found in the dictionary, it returns an empty list.

4. `pilCTAs`: This method takes a PIL (Product Identifier Line) code as an argument and returns all call to action statements for that code. If the code is not found in the dictionary, it returns an empty list.

5. `genericCTAs`: This method returns a list of generic call to action statements.

6. `ctaDict`: This method returns a dictionary where the keys are phen/sig codes and the values are methods that return call to action statements for those codes.

The code file also contains a software history section that documents changes made to the file over time, including the date of change, the ticket number, the engineer who made the change, and a description of the change.

The provided code is written in Python and seems to be part of a larger system related to weather forecasting and alerts. It contains several methods that return dictionaries and lists of strings. 

1. `ctaPilDict(self)`: This method returns a dictionary where the keys are abbreviations of products, possibly related to weather phenomena, and the values are methods that presumably return some form of call to action related to the respective product. 

2. `winterWScta(self)` and `winterWWcta(self)`: These methods return lists of tuples. Each tuple contains a string describing a specific winter weather condition and a corresponding call to action or advisory message. 

3. `ctaAFW(self)` and `ctaAFY(self)`: These methods return lists of strings that seem to be advisory messages related to ashfall warnings and advisories. 

The comments in the code indicate that these methods are used to provide specific definitions and advisory messages for different weather conditions. The messages can be used by a forecaster to provide specific advice and warnings to the public. The code also suggests that users can add additional entries, possibly allowing for customization or expansion of the system's capabilities.

This code file appears to be a collection of methods that return warning or advisory messages related to different weather conditions. Each method corresponds to a specific type of weather situation and returns a string with a detailed explanation of what that situation means and what precautions should be taken. 

Here's a brief overview of what each method represents:

- `ctaASO`: Returns a message about an Air Stagnation Outlook.
- `ctaASY`: Returns a message about an Air Stagnation Advisory.
- `ctaBHS`: Returns a message about a Beach Hazards Statement.
- `ctaBWY`: Returns a message about a Brisk Wind Advisory.
- `ctaBZW`: Returns a message about a Blizzard Warning.
- `ctaCFA`: Returns a message about a Coastal Flood Watch.
- `ctaCFW`: Returns a message about a Coastal Flood Warning.
- `ctaCFY`: Returns a message about a Coastal Flood Advisory.
- `ctaDUW`: Returns a message about a Blowing Dust Warning.
- `ctaDUY`: Returns a message about a Blowing Dust Advisory.
- `ctaECA`: Returns a message about an Extreme Cold Watch.
- `ctaECW`: Returns a message about an Extreme Cold Warning.
- `ctaEHA`: Returns a message about an Excessive Heat Watch.
- `ctaEHW`: Returns a message about an Excessive Heat Warning.
- `ctaFAA`: Returns a message about a Flood Watch.
- `ctaFFA`: Returns a message about a Flash Flood Watch.
- `ctaFGY`: Returns a message about a Dense Fog Advisory.

In each case, the method returns a list containing one or more strings. These strings provide detailed information about the weather condition, its potential effects, and the recommended precautions.

The provided code consists of a series of methods in a class (not shown in the snippet). Each method returns a list containing a single string. These strings appear to be weather advisories or warnings, each associated with a specific weather condition or event.

Here's a brief description of each method:

1. `ctaFRY`: Returns a frost advisory warning.
2. `ctaFWA`: Returns a fire weather watch warning.
3. `ctaFWW`: Returns a red flag warning related to fire weather conditions.
4. `ctaFZA`: Returns a freeze watch warning.
5. `ctaFZW`: Returns a freeze warning.
6. `ctaGLA`: Returns a gale watch warning.
7. `ctaGLW`: Returns a gale warning.
8. `ctaHFA`: Returns a hurricane force wind watch warning.
9. `ctaHFW`: Returns a hurricane force wind warning.
10. `ctaHTY`: Returns a heat advisory warning.
11. `ctaHUA`: Returns a hurricane watch warning.
12. `ctaHUW`: Returns a hurricane warning.
13. `ctaHWA`: Returns a high wind watch warning.
14. `ctaHWW`: Returns a high wind warning.
15. `ctaHZA`: Returns a hard freeze watch warning.
16. `ctaHZW`: Returns a hard freeze warning.
17. `ctaISW`: Returns an ice storm warning.
18. `ctaLEW`: Returns a lake effect snow warning.

Each of these methods can be called to get the corresponding weather warning or advisory message.

This code defines a series of methods in a class. Each method returns a list containing a string. The string is a warning or advisory message related to various weather or environmental conditions that could affect mariners and residents near bodies of water. 

For example, the method `ctaLOY` returns a Low Water Advisory message, `ctaLSA` returns a Lakeshore Flood Watch message, `ctaLSW` returns a Lakeshore Flood Warning message, and so on. 

These methods could be used in a larger program to provide relevant warnings or advisories based on detected or forecasted conditions.

The provided code is written in Python and appears to be a part of a larger program. It contains a series of methods that return specific warning messages related to weather conditions. Each method represents a different type of weather condition or warning, and returns a string with a detailed description of what that warning means. 

For example, the method `ctaTRA` returns a string explaining what a "Tropical Storm Watch" means, while the method `ctaUPA` returns a string explaining what a "Heavy Freezing Spray Watch" means. 

The methods are named with a prefix of "cta" which could stand for "Call To Action", followed by a three-letter abbreviation representing the specific weather condition or warning. 

The last part of the code shows a series of empty methods named with a prefix of "ctaPil", which could possibly stand for "Call To Action Product Pil". These methods currently return an empty list, but they could be designed to return specific actions or information related to different products or services in the context of the given weather warning. 

Overall, this code seems to be part of a larger system designed to provide detailed weather warnings and advisories.

This code file appears to be a part of a larger system that provides warnings or advisories about various environmental hazards. 

The first part of the file is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a string identifier for a type of hazard (like rip currents, longshore currents, sneaker waves, etc.) and a string that provides information about that hazard. Some of these tuples have placeholders like "Add CTA here", indicating that the content for these hazards is yet to be added.

The second part of the file contains a series of empty methods (functions) named `ctaPilCWF`, `ctaPilEQR`, `ctaPilESF`, etc. These methods currently return empty lists, but it seems like they are intended to return specific warnings or advisories based on their names.

The method `ctaPilHLS` is the only one that returns a list of tuples similar to the first part of the file, but these tuples are related to different types of flooding hazards and their descriptions. 

Overall, this code seems to be a part of a system that generates or handles advisories for different types of environmental hazards, possibly for a weather or environmental monitoring application.

The provided code appears to be a part of a larger Python script. It seems to be related to weather forecasting, specifically to hurricanes and tropical storms. 

The code contains a list of tuples, where each tuple consists of a string describing a weather condition or a warning and a corresponding message. These messages provide detailed information about the potential hazards and safety precautions related to the specific weather conditions. 

The script also contains a series of empty method definitions. Each method is named in the format `ctaPilXXX`, where `XXX` seems to be an abbreviation or code related to a specific weather condition or warning. The purpose of these methods is not clear from the provided code, as they are currently empty and do not perform any operations. 

The method names such as `ctaPilHMW`, `ctaPilHWO`, `ctaPilLAE`, etc., suggest that they might be intended to handle specific weather conditions or warnings. However, without additional context or code, it's hard to determine their exact purpose. 

In summary, this code seems to be a part of a weather forecasting system, providing detailed warnings and safety information for various hazardous weather conditions. However, the provided code is incomplete and its full functionality cannot be determined without additional context.

This code defines four empty methods: `ctaPilVOW`, `ctaPilWCN`, `ctaPilWSW`, and `ctaPilZFP`. Each of these methods, when called, will return an empty list. However, without additional context or content within these methods, it's hard to determine their intended purpose. The first `return []` statement seems to be outside any function or method, which might cause an error depending on the context it is in.</p>
