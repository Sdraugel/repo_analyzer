                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This code is a Python file that defines a class named `GetClusterMembersRequest`. This class currently has only one method, the `__init__` method, which is the constructor for the class. The constructor doesn't do anything at the moment as it just contains the `pass` statement.

The comments at the top of the file provide some context about the software. It was developed and/or modified by Raytheon Company under a contract with the US Government. The software contains export-restricted data, so its export/transfer/disclosure is restricted by U.S. law. Any dissemination to non-U.S. persons, whether in the United States or abroad, requires an export license or other authorization. The contractor's name, address, and contact number are also provided.

The file also mentions that it was auto-generated against an equivalent DynamicSerialize Java class, suggesting that this Python class may be part of a system that also includes Java code, and that this Python class may be designed to mimic the behavior of a Java class in that system.</p>
