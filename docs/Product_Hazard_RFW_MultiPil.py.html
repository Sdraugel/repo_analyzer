                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This Python code file appears to be part of a larger system, possibly a weather forecasting system, given the references to terms like "FireWx" (Fire Weather), "forecast", and "expireTime". The code is developed or modified by Raytheon Company under a US Government contract and contains export-restricted data.

The code defines a class `TextProduct` that inherits from `GenericHazards.TextProduct`. This class seems to be used for generating text-based weather hazard reports, specifically for fire weather watch/warning scenarios.

The class has several attributes that define the structure and content of the report, such as the product name, station ID, WMO ID, product pil, and other identifiers. It also includes configuration for the output file, purge time, city inclusion, zone names, issue time, line length, overview inclusion, and other report formatting details.

The class has two methods: `__init__` and `allowedHazards`. The `__init__` method is the constructor that initializes the class. The `allowedHazards` method returns a list of allowed hazard types and actions.

The `_preProcessArea` function appears to be used for pre-processing data related to a specific geographical area before generating a report. It creates an area header for an edit area combination.

Overall, this code seems to be part of a system for generating and managing weather-related hazard warnings.

The provided code appears to be part of a larger system, likely related to weather forecasting or hazard warnings. The function `hazardBodyText(self, hazardList, argDict)` is responsible for generating a text description of a list of hazards.

The function first sorts the hazards by importance, with the order of importance being 'W', 'Y', 'A', 'S'. 

Then, it separates the sorted hazards into different lists based on their 'act' value. The 'act' value seems to represent the action associated with the hazard, such as 'NEW' for new hazards, 'CAN' for cancelled hazards, 'EXP' for expired hazards, 'EXT' for extended hazards, 'UPG' for upgraded hazards, and 'S' for statement hazards.

After that, the function generates descriptive phrases for each hazard in each list. These phrases include information about the hazard's headline ('hdln'), the time it's in effect, and the city of the National Weather Service office issuing the warning (`self._wfoCity`). 

The function handles different scenarios, such as if it's the first hazard being described, if the hazard has the same headline as the previous one, or if there are additional hazards. It also has specific phrase templates for new, cancelled, expired, extended, and upgraded hazards.

The function skips hazards that don't have a defined headline or if it's a bullet product (as indicated by `self._bulletProd`).

The final output of this function is a string (`hazardBodyPhrase`) that contains the complete text description of all the hazards in the input list.

The code appears to be part of a larger system that processes hazard warnings. It seems to be written in Python and involves several steps:

1. It processes a list of hazards, appending a phrase to a string (`hazardBodyPhrase`) indicating whether each hazard is still in effect or not. This is done for two types of hazards: 'con' hazards and 'statement' hazards.

2. For 'con' hazards, it checks if a headline is defined for each hazard. If not, it skips the hazard. If a headline is defined, it appends a phrase to `hazardBodyPhrase` indicating that the hazard remains in effect, along with the time the hazard ends.

3. The code for 'statement' hazards is commented out, so it doesn't do anything at the moment. However, it seems like it would append a placeholder for statement text to `hazardBodyPhrase`.

4. It then checks a list of sorted hazards and processes the previous text associated with each hazard. This involves cleaning the text, splitting it into bullets, and reformatting it. If the user wants to use gridded data for elevation and location info, the code replaces the relevant bullets with this data.

5. The cleaned and reformatted text is then appended to `hazardBodyPhrase`, provided it passes certain checks (e.g., it isn't too short or blank).

6. If the segment doesn't pass the checks, and if it's a 'bullet product', the code seems to prepare to append a cancellation message to `hazardBodyPhrase`, but this part of the code is incomplete.

Please note that without the full context or the complete code, this is a high-level interpretation and some details might be missing or misinterpreted.

This Python code appears to be part of a larger system that processes and generates hazard warnings. Here's a breakdown of the main parts:

1. The first part of the code is constructing a string `hazardBodyPhrase` based on different conditions. If the `act` attribute of `eachHazard` is either 'CAN' or 'EXP', it appends a wrap-up text to `hazardBodyPhrase`. If `act` is not 'CAN' or 'EXP', it retrieves a list of bullets from a dictionary and appends them to `hazardBodyPhrase`. If none of these conditions are met, it appends a segment text to `hazardBodyPhrase`.

2. The next section of the code is related to "call to action" (CTA) statements. It first removes any CTAs from `forceCTAList` that are already in `foundCTAs`. Then it appends a default CTA for each item in `forceCTAList` to a list `ctas`. If `ctas` is not empty, it appends a header and all CTAs to `hazardBodyPhrase`.

3. The code then ensures there is only one CAP tag pair in `hazardBodyPhrase` by removing any extra occurrences.

4. The `hazard_hook` method appears to be used to generate a phrase for a hazard warning. It checks the source of the elevation data, and based on that, it either constructs a phrase using forecaster selections and a dictionary of phrases/bullets, or it retrieves the phrase from a previous product.

5. The `makeHeadlinePhrases` method generates a list of hazard headlines. It first sorts the hazards, then it iterates over them. For each hazard, it checks if it has a headline and if its action is allowed. If both conditions are met, it generates a standard phrase for the hazard and calls the `hazard_hook` method to generate a local phrase. The local phrase is then appended to the standard phrase.

The code is written in Python and seems to be part of a larger program that deals with fire weather zones. 

1. The `_headlineNumbers` function takes a list of IDs, removes the first three characters from each ID, sorts the modified IDs, and then constructs a string that specifies either a single fire weather zone or multiple fire weather zones, depending on the number of IDs in the list.

2. The `_getLocationsList` function takes a dictionary of areas, a dictionary of arguments, and a segment. It accesses the UGC (Universal Geographic Code) information for each area in the segment, logs any missing information, and then sorts the UGCs by state. It then constructs a string that specifies the fire weather zones for each state, either including or excluding the zone names depending on the value of `_noNameInBullet`.

3. The `_getBullets` function sets up a list of bullets based on the type of RFW (Red Flag Warning, a term used in fire weather forecasting) specified by the user. If the user has entered anything, it appends the corresponding bullets from a dictionary to the list, and then appends "Impacts". 

The code also contains several comments indicating that certain parts of the code were inserted or overridden for specific cases, suggesting that this code may be part of a larger system that has been customized for specific use cases.

The provided code appears to be part of a larger Python program, likely for generating formatted text reports, possibly related to weather or hazard warnings. Here's a breakdown of the main parts:

1. The first part of the code is creating a list of bullet points (`bList`) and removing any duplicates from it. It then initializes an empty string `bullets` and loops through `bList`. Depending on the value of each bullet, it formats the bullet point in a specific way and adds it to the `bullets` string.

2. The `_buildForPhrase` method appears to be used for extracting specific information from a previous hazard warning (`prevText` in `eHazard`). It uses regular expressions to search for and extract this information, which is then returned as a string.

3. The `_makeProduct` method seems to be responsible for generating a full report or product. It does this by generating a headline, attributions, calls-to-action, and an overview if it exists. The final report is then cleaned up and returned.

4. The `_postProcessProduct` method appears to be used for finalizing the report. It inserts an overview if it exists, adds line feeds to separate certain sections, cleans up multiple line feeds, and adds a URL from the configuration section. It also updates a progress meter.

5. The `cleanCapturedText` method seems to be used for processing a block of text. It wraps the text preserving blank lines, removes headlines, and optionally adds framing codes. It returns the part of the text after a specified number of paragraphs.

Overall, the code seems to be part of a system for generating, formatting, and post-processing text reports. Without more context or the full code file, it's difficult to provide a more specific analysis.

This code is part of a text processing function in Python. Here's what it does:

1. It starts by converting the input text into single paragraphs using the `convertSingleParas` method.

2. It initializes an empty list `foundCTAs` to keep track of any call to actions (CTAs) found in the text.

3. It initializes a counter `paraCount` and an empty string `processedText`.

4. Then, it loops over each paragraph in the `paras` list. If the paragraph count is greater than or equal to a certain threshold (the `paragraphs` variable), it checks for any CTAs in that paragraph using the `ctasFound` method. If the `skipCTAs` flag is set and there are any CTAs found, it skips that paragraph. Otherwise, it adds the paragraph to the `processedText` string and also adds any new CTAs found to the `foundCTAs` list.

5. If the paragraph starts with '...', it ignores that paragraph (presumably these are headlines).

6. It increments the paragraph count after processing each paragraph.

7. After processing all paragraphs, if the `addFramingCodes` flag is set, it adds framing codes to the `processedText` string.

8. It then wraps the `processedText` string to a certain line length using the `endline` method, breaking the lines at spaces, hyphens, or ellipses.

9. Finally, it returns the processed text and the list of found CTAs.</p>
