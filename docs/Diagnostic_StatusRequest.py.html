                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>The provided code seems to be a Python script. The first part of the file is a comment block that provides legal and contractual information about the software. It specifies that the software was developed or modified by Raytheon Company under a specific contract with the US Government. It also mentions that the software contains export-restricted data, and its dissemination to non-U.S. persons requires an export license or other authorization.

The comment block also provides the contractor's name and address, and refers to a document named "Master Rights File.pdf" for further licensing information.

The second part of the file defines a Python class named `StatusRequest`. This class is likely a part of a larger software system and seems to be auto-generated against an equivalent DynamicSerialize Java class, as indicated by the comment. The class currently has a constructor (`__init__`) that doesn't do anything (`pass`). This class might be used as a base class or placeholder for future development.</p>
