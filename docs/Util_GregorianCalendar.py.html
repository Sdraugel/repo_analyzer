                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This code file appears to be a part of a larger software system that was developed or modified by Raytheon Company under a contract with the US Government. The software contains export-restricted data, meaning its export/transfer/disclosure is restricted by U.S. law and requires an export license or other authorization for dissemination to non-U.S. persons.

The contractor's name and address are provided, and there's a reference to a document called the "AWIPS II Master Rights File" for further licensing information.

The code itself defines a custom Python class that represents a simplified version of the java.util.GregorianCalendar class. This class is stripped down to only support minimal methods for serialization.

The class, named `GregorianCalendar`, has an instance variable `time` which is initialized as `None` in the constructor method. 

There are three methods in this class:
1. `getInstance()`: This is a static method that returns a new instance of the GregorianCalendar class.
2. `getTimeInMillis()`: This method returns the value of the `time` instance variable.
3. `setTimeInMillis(timeInMillis)`: This method sets the value of the `time` instance variable to the argument `timeInMillis`.

The software history indicates that the initial creation of this part of the software was done by an engineer named "wldougher" on September 29, 2010.</p>
