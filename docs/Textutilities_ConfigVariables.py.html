                <div class="description">
                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>The provided code is a Python script that appears to be part of a larger software system developed by Raytheon Company. This script, named `ConfigVariables.py`, is used to manage configuration variables for text products. 

The script defines a class `ConfigVariables` which inherits from `TextUtils` class. The `ConfigVariables` class has a constructor that initializes the parent class and two methods: `missingData_notification_list` and `phrase_descriptor_dict`. 

The `missingData_notification_list` method returns an empty list. It seems to be a placeholder for a list of weather element names for which the system should notify the user when there is missing data.

The `phrase_descriptor_dict` method returns a dictionary that maps various weather elements to their descriptors. These descriptors are used in phrases that describe the weather conditions. For example, the key "HeatIndex" is mapped to the descriptor "heat index readings". 

The dictionary also includes keys for different weather conditions and their corresponding descriptions. For instance, "SnowSleetIceCrystal" is mapped to "snow and sleet accumulation". Some keys are commented out, indicating that they are not currently in use but could be activated if needed.

The script also contains a software history section that logs changes made to the script over time. For example, on March 15, 2020, a change was made to use `ApparentT` instead of `WindChill/HeatIndex`.

The code is marked as being in the public domain and is furnished "as is", meaning that it comes without any warranty or technical support. It also contains a notice about U.S. export control, indicating that the software contains export-restricted data.

The provided code is written in Python and it appears to be part of a larger program that generates weather forecasts or similar reports. It contains several dictionaries and methods that seem to be used for translating or formatting certain phrases or terms.

1. The first dictionary maps certain phrases or terms to their corresponding descriptions or translations. For example, "covery..." is mapped to "Humidity recovery...". This could be used to translate shorthand or code words into more understandable phrases.

2. The `phrase_descriptor` method is a function that seems to access the first dictionary using the provided `key` and `value`.

3. The `phrase_connector_dict` method returns a dictionary that maps certain phrases to their corresponding connectors. These connectors are used to join phrases together in a sentence. For example, "then" is mapped to " then becoming " for the "Sky" key and " then " for the "otherwise" key.

4. The `phrase_connector` method is a function that seems to access the `phrase_connector_dict` using the provided `key` and `value`.

5. The `useThenConnector_dict`, `thenConnector_dict`, `value_connector_dict`, and `units_descriptor_dict` methods return similar dictionaries that map certain keys to their corresponding phrases or terms.

6. The `useThenConnector`, `thenConnector`, `value_connector`, and `units_descriptor` methods are functions that seem to access their respective dictionaries using the provided `key` and `value`.

Overall, this code seems to be part of a system that generates text based on certain keys and values, likely for weather forecasting or similar applications.

This code is written in Python and appears to be part of a larger program that deals with weather data and its units of measurement. 

The code contains several dictionaries that map various weather-related terms to their corresponding units of measurement. For example, "QPF" is mapped to "in" (inches), "Wind" is mapped to "kts" (knots), and "HeatIndex" is mapped to "F" (Fahrenheit). These dictionaries seem to be used for converting units or for providing a reference for what units certain weather data should be in.

The code also contains several methods that access these dictionaries. These methods take in a tree, node, key, and value as parameters and return the corresponding value from the specified dictionary. 

For example, the `units_descriptor` method accesses the "units_descriptor_dict", and the `element_inUnits` method accesses the "element_inUnits_dict". 

The `maxReported_threshold_dict` method returns a dictionary that seems to set a maximum threshold for certain weather conditions. For example, "Wind" and "Wind20ft" are both set to a maximum of 200 knots or mph. 

The `range_nlValue_dict` method returns a dictionary that seems to set a range of values for certain weather conditions. For example, "MaxT", "MinT", "MinRH", "MaxRH", and "RH" are all set to a range of 5. 

The `maximum_range_nlValue_dict` and `minimum_range_nlValue_dict` methods seem to set maximum and minimum ranges for certain weather conditions, but the dictionaries they return are currently empty.

The provided code is written in Python and appears to be part of a larger system that processes weather data. It includes several methods that define and access dictionaries. These dictionaries seem to be used for configuring certain parameters related to weather data processing and reporting. Here's a breakdown of what some of the methods do:

1. `minimum_range_nlValue`: This method accesses a dictionary that defines the minimum range of values for different weather parameters. 

2. `range_bias_nlValue_dict`: This method returns a dictionary that defines whether the range should be taken from the minimum, average, or maximum value of the current range for different weather parameters.

3. `maximum_range_bias_nlValue_dict`: This method returns a dictionary that defines whether the maximum range should be taken from the minimum, average, or maximum value of the current range for different weather parameters.

4. `minimum_range_bias_nlValue_dict`: This method returns a dictionary that defines whether the minimum range should be taken from the minimum, average, or maximum value of the current range for different weather parameters.

5. `highValue_threshold_dict`: This method returns a dictionary that defines the threshold values for high wind conditions for different weather parameters.

6. `first_null_phrase_dict`: This method returns a dictionary that defines the phrases to use if values throughout the period or in the first period are null (i.e., below threshold or NoWx) for different weather parameters.

7. `null_phrase_dict`: This method returns a dictionary that defines the phrases to use for null values in subPhrases other than the first for different weather parameters.

8. `scalar_difference_nlValue_dict`: This method returns a dictionary that defines the scalar difference values for different weather parameters. If the difference between scalar values for 2 sub-periods is greater than or equal to this value, the different values will be noted in the phrase.

The commented out code at the beginning explains how a threshold is used to adjust the range of values reported. For example, if the threshold is set to 5 for "MaxT", and the min value is 45 and the max value is 46, the range will be adjusted to at least a 5 degree range e.g. 43-48.

This code appears to be part of a larger Python script, possibly for a weather forecasting application or system. It contains a series of methods that handle various weather-related data such as temperature, wind speed, visibility, etc.

Here's a brief summary of what each method does:

1. `scalar_difference_nlValue`: This method accesses a dictionary with given parameters.

2. `pop_lower_threshold` and `pop_upper_threshold`: These methods return thresholds for the probability of precipitation (PoP). Values below or above these thresholds will not be reported.

3. `popThreshold`: This method calculates the threshold for the probability of precipitation based on the duration and hours past the product start.

4. `lowPop_flag`: This method checks the probability of precipitation against a given threshold and returns 1 if it is below that threshold, 0 if it is above, and None if there is no data.

5. `null_nlValue_dict` and `null_nlValue`: These methods handle "null" values for various weather-related data.

6. `null_alwaysDistinct_flag_dict` and `null_alwaysDistinct_flag`: These methods handle whether null values should be considered distinct from non-null values.

7. `increment_nlValue_dict` and `increment_nlValue`: These methods handle the increment for rounding values for various weather-related data.

8. `rounding_method_dict` and `rounding_method`: These methods handle special rounding methods for weather-related data.

9. `adjust_method_dict` and `adjust_method`: These methods handle special conversion methods for weather-related data.

10. `marineRounding`: This method handles rounding for marine winds.

11. `vector_mag_difference_nlValue_dict`: This method handles the magnitude difference for wind speed.

The dictionary at the beginning of the code snippet appears to be defining some default values for various weather-related data.

This code appears to be part of a larger Python program, possibly related to weather forecasting or meteorology. It defines a number of methods that manipulate and access various dictionaries, likely related to weather data. Here's a breakdown of the key parts:

1. `vector_mag_difference_nlValue`, `vector_dir_difference`, `vector_dir_difference_nlValue`, `embedded_vector_descriptor_flag`, `trend_threshold`, `combine_singleValues_flag`, `untilPhrasing_flag`, `onTheFly_untilPhrasing_flag`, `untilPhrasing_format`: These methods access specific dictionaries based on the provided tree, node, key, and value parameters. The specific dictionary accessed is determined by the string passed in the last parameter.

2. `vector_dir_difference_dict`, `vector_dir_difference_nlValue_dict`, `embedded_vector_descriptor_flag_dict`, `trend_threshold_dict`, `combine_singleValues_flag_dict`, `untilPhrasing_flag_dict`, `onTheFly_untilPhrasing_flag_dict`, `untilPhrasing_format_dict`: These methods return specific dictionaries. The dictionaries contain key-value pairs that represent different weather-related parameters and their respective values or thresholds.

3. `seaBreeze_thresholds`, `seaBreeze_areaLabels`: These methods are related to sea breezes. The former returns offshore and onshore wind direction boundaries, while the latter returns the labels for offshore and onshore local effect areas.

4. `removeEmptyPhrase`: This method seems to remove empty phrases from a given text, but the code is incomplete, so the exact functionality cannot be determined.

The dictionaries and methods in this code are likely used to analyze and manipulate weather data, possibly for the purpose of generating weather forecasts or reports.

This code is defining a set of methods for handling and manipulating weather data. The methods are designed to be used in a larger system, likely for weather forecasting or analysis. Here's a breakdown of what each method does:

1. `periodCombining_elementList`: This method returns a list of weather elements that are used to determine whether to combine periods. The elements include sky conditions, wind, weather, probability of precipitation, and maximum and minimum temperature.

2. `periodCombining_startHour`: This method returns the hour after which periods may be combined. In this case, it's 36 hours.

3. `collapseSubPhrase_hours_dict` and `collapseSubPhrase_hours`: These methods define the rules for collapsing sub-phrases for combined periods. If a period is longer than the specified hours, sub-phrases will automatically be collapsed.

4. `mergeMethod_dict` and `mergeMethod`: These methods define the merge method to use when sub-phrases are automatically collapsed.

5. `nextDay24HourLabel_flag` and `splitDay24HourLabel_flag`: These methods control how 24-hour periods are labeled. They can be set to label the period as the next day or to split the period into day and night labels.

6. `mostImportant_dict`, `mostImportant`, `mostImportant_descriptor_dict`, and `mostImportant_descriptor`: These methods are used to report only the most important sub-phrase for certain weather elements.

7. `matchToWxInfo_dict`: This method matches certain weather elements to the highest ranking weather subkey coverage. It includes rules for increment, algorithm, and no precipitation value. 

The code also includes several commented-out sections, which could be used to modify the behavior of the system for different scenarios or use cases.

The code appears to be part of a larger weather forecasting system. It includes several functions and configurations for handling and presenting weather data. Here's a breakdown of the main parts:

1. The first part of the code describes a configuration for weather data processing, including how to handle different weather elements like "PoP" (probability of precipitation) and "LAL" (lightning activity level). It specifies how to calculate these values (e.g., taking the maximum value, mode, etc.) and under what conditions (e.g., coverage threshold, weather types).

2. The `matchToWxInfo` function seems to be a method for accessing specific weather information from a tree-like data structure.

3. The `alphabetizeHeaders` function returns 0, indicating that the zones and cities of area headers should not be alphabetized.

4. The next section of comments describes how to handle local effects for headlines in a weather report. It provides examples of how to customize the output for specific local conditions, like "in the mountains" or "for lower elevations". 

5. The `hazard_hook` function is a placeholder that can be overridden to provide specific handling for different types of weather hazards. The current implementation simply returns an empty string.

6. The `repeatingEmbedded_localEffect_threshold` function sets a threshold for the number of local effect phrases allowed in a component before they are gathered into a conjunctive local effect clause. This is used to improve the readability of the weather forecast.

This code appears to be part of a larger system, possibly a weather forecasting software, that generates textual weather forecasts. It seems to be written in Python and defines several methods that control how weather conditions are described in different areas (e.g., windward and leeward).

1. The first method returns an integer value of 2. The comments suggest that this method is used to control the formatting of weather conditions when there are conjunctive local effects. Instead of separating conditions for different areas, it combines them into a single sentence for each area.

2. The second method, `repeatingPhrase_localEffect_threshold`, is not yet implemented according to the comments. It appears to control how many repeating local effect phrases are allowed in a set of conjunctive local effects. It currently returns 1, which according to the comments, means that the same phrase can be repeated once within a set of conjunctive local effects.

3. The third method, `repeatingPhrase_localEffect_categories`, returns a list of categories of phrases that can be repeated within a set of conjunctive local effects. These categories include "skyPopWx_phrase", "sky_phrase", "weather_phrase", "popMax_phrase", and "ALL OTHER PHRASES".

4. The fourth method, `lePhraseNameGroups`, returns a list of tuples. Each tuple represents a group of phrase names that can be combined into embedded local effect phrases. If a phrase is not listed in any of these groups, it is assumed that only phrases with the same name can be combined with it into an embedded local effect phrase. 

Overall, these methods seem to be part of a larger system that generates weather forecasts in a human-readable format, taking into account various factors such as local effects and the repetition of phrases.</p>
