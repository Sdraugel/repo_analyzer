                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This Python script is part of a software developed by Raytheon Company under a contract with the US Government. The software contains export-restricted data, and its dissemination to non-US persons, whether in the US or abroad, requires an export license or other authorization.

The script appears to be a base file that is not intended to be overridden, but can be subclassed to override behavior. It's related to the Configuration Guides->Smart Initialization Configuration section of the GFE Online Help.

The script is named `nwpsTrkngCG0AKQ` and was created by Joe Maloney on 2016-07-08. It is a Smart Init for the `nwpsTrkngCG0AKQ` model.

The script imports everything from the `Init` and `nwpsTrkngCG0` modules. It then defines a class `nwpsTrkngCG0AKQForecaster` that inherits from `nwpsTrkngCG0Forecaster`. This class has an `__init__` method that initializes the superclass with the name "nwpsTrkngCG0AKQ".

The script also defines a `main` function that creates an instance of `nwpsTrkngCG0AKQForecaster`, runs it, and then notifies GFE with 'AKQ'. If the script is run as a standalone program (i.e., not imported as a module), it calls the `main` function.

In summary, this script seems to be part of a larger system (possibly a weather forecasting system given the names of the modules and classes) and is responsible for initializing and running a specific forecasting model.</p>
