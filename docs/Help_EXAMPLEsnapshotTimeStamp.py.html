                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>The provided code is a configuration file, likely written in Python, for a software developed or modified by Raytheon Company under a US Government contract. 

The initial part of the code is a legal disclaimer, stating that the software contains export-restricted data, and its dissemination to non-U.S. persons, whether within the United States or abroad, requires an export license or other authorization. It also provides the contractor's name and address, and refers to a Master Rights File for further licensing information.

The actual code begins with importing everything from the `gfeConfig` module. It also imports the `gfeConfig` module itself. 

Then, it defines a list `Png_parms` with two strings. These strings appear to represent weather elements (temperature and sky conditions) to be displayed, likely in some graphical format (as suggested by the "Png" prefix).

The variable `Png_snapshotTime` is set to 1, which might represent the frequency or timing of snapshots or updates.

The `Png_legendFormat_Zulu_snapshot` variable is set to a string representing a date-time format. This suggests that the software may be creating snapshots or images with legends that include a timestamp in this format. The format appears to be a Zulu time (Coordinated Universal Time or UTC) format, which includes abbreviated month, day, hour, and minute followed by 'Z' to indicate Zulu time.</p>
