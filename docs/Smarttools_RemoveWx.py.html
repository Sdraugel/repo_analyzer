                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This code is a part of a weather analysis tool developed by Raytheon Company. It's a script that removes mentions of a specific weather condition from a dataset, leaving all other data untouched. The weather conditions are represented by specific codes, such as "T" for Thunder, "R" for Rain, and so on.

The script is designed to work with a graphical user interface (GUI), where the user can select the weather condition they want to remove from a list. 

Here's a brief overview of what the code does:

1. It imports necessary libraries and modules, including numpy and WxMethods.

2. It defines a list of weather codes that the user can choose to remove from the dataset.

3. It defines a class called Tool that inherits from the SmartScript class. This class has methods to preprocess, postprocess, and execute the main function of the tool.

4. The `preProcessTool` method saves the current combine mode and sets it to "Replace". The `postProcessTool` method sets the combine mode back to its original state after the tool has run.

5. The `execute` method is the main function of the tool. It takes the weather data and a dictionary of variables as input. It removes the specified weather code from the data and returns the modified data.

6. The `execute` method works by creating a table of all keys that need changing and what they will change to. It then updates the weather data with the new keys.

This script is a part of a larger system, and it's designed to be used in conjunction with other scripts and tools.</p>
