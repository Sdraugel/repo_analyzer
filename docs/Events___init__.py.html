                    <p>This part of the file is primarily a legal notice and metadata about the file. 

The first section is a legal notice from Raytheon Company, stating that the software was developed or modified by them under a specific contract with the US Government. It also mentions that the software contains export-restricted data, meaning it can't be shared outside of the U.S. without proper authorization. The contractor's name, address, and contact information are also provided.

The second part of the file indicates that the file was auto-generated by a tool called PythonFileGenerator. 

The last part of the file is Python code that defines a list named `__all__`. This list contains a single string, 'hazards'. In Python, `__all__` is a special variable that defines the public interface of a module. It specifies which names should be imported when a client imports a module using the `from module import *` syntax. In this case, if a client were to import this module using that syntax, only the 'hazards' name would be imported.</p>
