                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This code is part of a utility module for dealing with tropical cyclone hazards in an active table. 

The code starts with a list of tropical phenomena (TROPICAL_PHENS) which includes 'TR', 'TY', 'HU', and 'SS'. 

Then, it defines a function named `get_tropical_storm_basin` that takes a record as an argument. This function is used to determine the basin of a tropical storm based on its 'etn' (Estimated Time of Arrival) value. 

The function first checks if the 'phen' (phenomenon) of the record is in the list of tropical phenomena. If not, it raises a ValueError with a message indicating that the active table record is not for a tropical hazard. 

If the 'phen' is in the list, the function then checks the 'etn' value of the record. Depending on the range this 'etn' falls into, the function returns a string indicating the basin of the storm: 'AT' for Atlantic, 'TEST' for testing, 'EP' for Eastern Pacific, 'CP' for Central Pacific, and 'WP' for Western Pacific. 

If the 'etn' doesn't fall into any of these ranges, the function raises a ValueError with a message indicating that the tropical hazard has an 'etn' outside any known basin 'etn' range. 

The initial comments in the code indicate that this software was developed or modified by Raytheon Company, and it contains export-restricted data whose export/transfer/disclosure is restricted by U.S. law. The comments also provide some software history, including the dates of initial creation and a subsequent modification.</p>
