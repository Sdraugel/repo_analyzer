                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This code appears to be part of a software tool developed by Raytheon Company for the US Government. The software is in the public domain and is furnished "as is", without any technical support or warranty.

The software is a tool for editing weather elements, specifically "Swell". It imports the numpy library, which is used for numerical operations in Python.

The code defines a class named 'Tool' which inherits from the 'SmartScript' class in the 'SmartScript' module. This class has an '__init__' method to initialize itself and an 'execute' method that takes 'Wind' as an argument and calculates 'SwellMag' and 'SwellDir' based on the input. The 'execute' method then returns these calculated values.

The code also includes some commented out sections which appear to be templates or instructions for further customization of the tool, such as setting up variables to be solicited from the user, optional methods for preprocessing and postprocessing, and error handling.

The 'ScreenList' variable seems to be used to screen the elements for which the tool will appear. It is currently set to ["Swell", "Swell2"].

The code also includes some explanations and instructions for understanding and using the code, such as what "self" refers to in the context of the class, and how to handle errors.</p>
