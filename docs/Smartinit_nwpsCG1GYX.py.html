                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This Python script is a part of a software developed by Raytheon Company. The software contains export-restricted data and its export/transfer/disclosure is controlled by U.S. law.

The script is a base file that is not intended to be overridden, but it can be subclassed to override behavior. It is related to the Smart Initialization Configuration section of the GFE Online Help.

The script is specifically designed for the nwpsCG1GYX model, as indicated by the comment made by Joe Maloney on 2016-07-18.

The script imports everything from the Init and nwpsCG1 modules. It then defines a class `nwpsCG1GYXForecaster` which is a subclass of `nwpsCG1Forecaster`. In the constructor of this class, it calls the constructor of the parent class with "nwpsCG1GYX" as the parameters.

The script also defines a main function. In this function, it creates an instance of `nwpsCG1GYXForecaster`, calls its `run` method, and then calls its `notifyGFE` method with 'GYX' as the parameter.

The main function is executed if the script is run as a standalone program (i.e., not imported as a module in another script).</p>
