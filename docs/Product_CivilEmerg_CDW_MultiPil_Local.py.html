                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>The provided code appears to be a part of a larger software system developed by Raytheon Company for the US Government. It is a Python script that generates a text product, specifically a Civil Danger Warning.

The script begins with a detailed comment section that includes information about the software's development, export control, the contractor's details, and licensing information. It also mentions that the software is in the public domain and provided "as is".

The script imports several modules: CivilEmerg, TextRules, string, time, re, os, types, and copy. These modules provide various functionalities that the script uses.

The script defines a class named TextProduct that inherits from CivilEmerg.TextProduct. The class has a dictionary named Definition, which holds various details about the product like its name, WMO code, product pil, etc.

The class has two methods: `__init__` and `_makeProduct`. The `__init__` method is the constructor that initializes the class. The `_makeProduct` method is used to generate the text for the Civil Danger Warning. It takes four arguments: fcst, editArea, areaLabel, and argDict. The method appends a message to the fcst string and returns it.

This script appears to be a part of a larger system that deals with emergency warnings or alerts. The generated text product might be used for broadcasting or disseminating civil danger warnings.</p>
