                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This Python script is part of a software developed by Raytheon Company, under a contract with the US Government. The software contains export-restricted data, and its dissemination to non-U.S. persons requires an export license or other authorization.

The script itself is a base file, not intended to be overridden, but it can be subclassed to override behavior. It's related to the configuration of a system called GFE (Gridpoint Statistical Interpolation).

The script imports two modules: Init and nwpsCG1. It defines a class `nwpsCG1TAEForecaster` which is a subclass of `nwpsCG1Forecaster` from the nwpsCG1 module. This class has an initializer method that calls the initializer of its parent class with two specific arguments: "nwpsCG1TAE" and "nwpsCG1TAE".

The script also defines a main function that creates an instance of `nwpsCG1TAEForecaster`, runs it, and then calls its `notifyGFE` method with the argument 'TAE'. This main function is executed if the script is run as a standalone program.

The comment at the top indicates that this script is a "Smart Init" for a model called `nwpsCG1TAE`, and it was written or modified by Joe Maloney on 2016-07-18. The purpose of a "Smart Init" is typically to initialize a model with intelligent default values or behaviors.</p>
