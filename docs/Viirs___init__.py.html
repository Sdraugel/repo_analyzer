                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>The provided text is not a code but a comment block that provides important information about the software. This is typically found at the start of a code file.

The comment block provides the following information:

1. The software was developed and/or modified by Raytheon Company under a specific contract with the U.S. Government.

2. The software contains export-restricted data, meaning its export/transfer/disclosure is restricted by U.S. law. Any dissemination to non-U.S. persons, whether in the U.S. or abroad, requires an export license or other authorization.

3. It provides the contractor's name (Raytheon Company) and address.

4. It refers to a document called the "AWIPS II Master Rights File" for further licensing information.

The last line of the comment, "# init script so Python treats functions folder as a package", is a separate comment that describes the purpose of the script. It indicates that the script is an initialization script used to make Python treat a folder named "functions" as a package. This is typically done by including a special file named "__init__.py" (which can be empty) in the directory.</p>
