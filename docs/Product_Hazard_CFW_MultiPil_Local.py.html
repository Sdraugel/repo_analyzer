                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This Python code is part of a software developed by Raytheon Company, which is subject to U.S. export control laws. The software is related to the AWIPS II system, a weather forecasting product. 

The specific code provided is a module named `Hazard_CFW_Local.py` which appears to be related to handling and processing hazard warnings related to coastal or lakeshore flooding. 

The module imports another module named `Hazard_CFW_<MultiPil>`, and then creates a new class `TextProduct` that inherits from `Hazard_CFW_<MultiPil>.TextProduct`. A deep copy of the `Definition` attribute from the parent class is created, and the `displayName` attribute is set to "Hazard_CFW_<MultiPil> (Coastal/LakeShore Flooding)".

The `__init__` method is defined for the `TextProduct` class, which calls the `__init__` method of the parent class. This is a common pattern used when you want to extend the behavior of the parent class without modifying it.

There are also some commented out lines of code which suggest that there might be optional features or settings that can be enabled, such as an EAS phrase to be included in the product header, a hazard sampling threshold, and a setting related to how cities are determined.

The comment at the end of the code indicates that this is a base file and should not be overridden, suggesting it contains fundamental code for the operation of the software.</p>
