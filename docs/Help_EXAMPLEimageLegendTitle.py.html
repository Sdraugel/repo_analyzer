                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This is a Python script that is part of a software developed or modified by Raytheon Company under a US Government contract. The software contains export-restricted data, and its dissemination to non-US persons, whether in the US or abroad, requires an export license or other authorization. The contractor's details are also provided.

The script is an example configuration file for ifpIMAGE, which is likely a module or function within the software. It imports everything from `gfeConfig`, which is presumably another Python module in the same software.

The script then defines `Png_parms` as a list containing a string, `'T_SFC:_Official -1'`. This could be a parameter for the ifpIMAGE configuration, possibly related to a surface temperature setting (as suggested by 'T_SFC').

`Png_image` is defined as `'T'`, which could be a shorthand or code for a specific image or image type in the software.

`Png_descriptiveWeName` is set to `'LONG'`, which might indicate that the software should use a long name for the weather element title.

However, without more context or documentation, it's hard to say exactly what these specific settings do within the software.</p>
