                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>The provided code is written in Python and it defines a class named `GetLockTablesRequest`. This class appears to be a data model or a data container, which is used to hold and manipulate data.

The class has three attributes: `requests`, `workstationID`, and `siteID`. All of these are initialized as `None` in the constructor method `__init__`.

The class also contains getter and setter methods for each of these attributes. Getter methods (`getRequests`, `getWorkstationID`, `getSiteID`) are used to retrieve the values of the attributes. Setter methods (`setRequests`, `setWorkstationID`, `setSiteID`) are used to set or update the values of the attributes.

The comment at the top of the code indicates that this file was auto-generated against an equivalent DynamicSerialize Java class. This suggests that this Python class is likely part of a system that includes both Python and Java code, and this class is designed to mirror or interface with a Java class in that system.

The large comment block at the top of the code is a legal disclaimer, stating that the code was developed by Raytheon Company under a specific contract with the US Government. It also contains export control information, contractor details, and a reference to a file with further licensing information.</p>
