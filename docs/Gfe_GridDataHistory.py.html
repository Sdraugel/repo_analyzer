                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This Python code defines a class named `GridDataHistory`. The class is used to store and manipulate data related to the history of some grid data.

The class has several attributes:
- `origin`: This could represent the source or origin of the data.
- `originParm`: This could be a parameter related to the origin.
- `originTimeRange`: This could represent the time range during which the data from the origin was collected or valid.
- `timeModified`: This could represent the time when the data was last modified.
- `whoModified`: This could represent the person or entity that last modified the data.
- `updateTime`: This could represent the time when the data was last updated.
- `publishTime`: This could represent the time when the data was published.
- `lastSentTime`: This could represent the last time the data was sent or transmitted.

The class also has several methods that are used to get and set the values of these attributes. These are standard getter and setter methods.

The `__str__` and `__repr__` methods are used to provide a string representation of the object. These methods are useful for debugging and logging purposes.
