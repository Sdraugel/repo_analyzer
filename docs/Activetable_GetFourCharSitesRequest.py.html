                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>The provided code is written in Python and it defines a class named `GetFourCharSitesRequest`. This class has an attribute `sites` and two methods: `getSites` and `setSites`.

The `__init__` method is a special method in Python classes, known as a constructor. This method is called when an object is created from the class and it allows the class to initialize the attributes of the class. In this case, the attribute `sites` is initialized to `None`.

The `getSites` method is a getter method that returns the value of the `sites` attribute.

The `setSites` method is a setter method that sets the value of the `sites` attribute to the value passed as an argument.

The comment at the top of the code is a legal disclaimer. It states that the software was developed and/or modified by Raytheon Company under a specific contract with the US Government. It also mentions that the software contains export-restricted data, which means it cannot be exported/transferred/disclosed without an export license or other authorization. The contractor's name, address, and contact information are also provided. Finally, it refers to a "Master Rights File.pdf" for further licensing information. 

The comment just before the class definition indicates that this Python file was auto-generated against an equivalent DynamicSerialize Java class. DynamicSerialization is a framework used for serializing and deserializing objects, often used in distributed systems.</p>
