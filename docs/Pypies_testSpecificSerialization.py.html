                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This Python script is a test for lightning serialization. It is part of a larger software developed by Raytheon Company under a contract with the US Government. The software contains export-restricted data, and its dissemination is controlled by U.S. law.

The script imports several modules and classes including `dynamicserialize`, `DatasetDataRequest`, `Request`, and `H5pyDataStore` from different packages.

The main function of this script is defined in the `main()` function. It does the following:

1. It creates a `DatasetDataRequest` object and sets its filename to a specific path where a METAR weather data file is located.

2. It sets the dataset group path with a list of weather parameters such as pressure, wind speed, temperature, etc.

3. It creates a `Request` object, sets its type to 'YLINE', and sets its indices to [4,14].

4. The `Request` object is then set to the `DatasetDataRequest` object.

5. An instance of `H5pyDataStore` is created and used to retrieve datasets based on the request.

6. The result is printed to the console.

7. The result is then serialized using `dynamicserialize` and written to a file named 'pyLight' in the '/tmp' directory.

The script is executed if it is run as the main program.</p>
