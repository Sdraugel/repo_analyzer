                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This is a Python script named MergeWFOEdits, authored by LeFebvre and Santos. It seems to be a part of a larger system, possibly related to weather forecasting or meteorology, given the use of terms like "WFO" (Weather Forecast Office), "grid", "hazard", etc. 

The script imports modules named TimeRange, TropicalUtility, and numpy. It defines a class named Procedure that inherits from TropicalUtility.TropicalUtility. 

The Procedure class has methods to fetch and process weather-related data. The fetchProposedWFOGrid method retrieves a grid of data for specified Weather Forecast Offices (WFOs). It processes these grids from latest to oldest, checking for hazards and overlaps with other areas.

The execute method uses the fetchProposedWFOGrid method to fetch a combined Hazards grid. It checks for conflicts between the fetched grid and the InitialSS grid, and if conflicts are found, it sends a message to the status bar.

The script also defines a list of WFOs and a variable named bogusWFO, which seems to be used as a default value for the check buttons in the GUI. 

The script is in the public domain and is provided without any warranty or technical support. It has been updated several times, with the latest updates including code cleanup, refactoring, and fixing issues with fetching split WFO grids.

This code is part of a larger system that appears to be dealing with weather forecasting, specifically storm surge warnings. 

Here's what the code is doing:

1. It intersects the selected area with the CWA (County Warning Area) areas to create a new, reduced area (`selectedMask`).

2. It further reduces the area to just the StormSurge editArea (`ssMask`).

3. It checks for conflicts between each WFO (Weather Forecast Office) and the InitialSS (Initial Storm Surge) grid.

4. It merges the WFO ISC (Inter-Service Coordination) grids into the ProposedSS (Proposed Storm Surge) grid. It does this by processing all the WFO proposed hazards, identifying where each WFO hazard intersects the selected area, getting the index of this hazard key within the NHC (National Hurricane Center) hazards, and converting the WFO key index to an NHC key index.

5. It deletes any existing collaboration difference grids and all versions of the 'ProposedSS' weather element.

6. It creates a new grid for the 'ProposedSS' weather element so it can be visualized.

7. It calculates a new difference grid for the given time range.

The purpose of this code seems to be to create a proposed storm surge grid by taking into account the input from various weather forecast offices and the National Hurricane Center, and then visualizing this proposed grid. It also calculates the difference between the initial and proposed storm surge grids.</p>
