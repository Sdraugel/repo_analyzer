                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This Python script is part of a larger software developed by Raytheon Company. It is designed to interact with a server to retrieve specific data related to active tables and default VTEC sites. 

The script starts by importing necessary modules and setting up logging. It then defines two functions: `getActiveTable` and `getDefaultVtecSites`.

The `getActiveTable` function is designed to retrieve an active table from a server. It takes several parameters including a table name, a list of sites, an optional site ID, and the host and port to connect to. If no sites are provided, it calls `getDefaultVtecSites` to get a list of default sites. It then creates a `GetActiveTableDictRequest` object and sets various parameters on it. This request is sent to the server using a `ThriftClient` object. If there's an error during this process, it logs the exception and returns None. Otherwise, it returns the active table received from the server.

The `getDefaultVtecSites` function is used to get a list of default VTEC sites from the server. It sends a request to the server to get the 'BackupDict' attribute, which is then converted to a dictionary if it's a string. The keys of this dictionary, which represent the site IDs, are returned as a list.

The script also contains a comment block at the top that provides information about the software's development and export control status, as well as licensing information.</p>
