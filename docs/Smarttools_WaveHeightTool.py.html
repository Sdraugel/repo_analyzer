                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This script appears to be part of a larger software system developed by Raytheon Company. It's a Python script that defines a tool for calculating wave height in a weather forecasting or oceanographic context. 

The script begins with a legal notice and contractor information, followed by a declaration that the software is in the public domain. 

The script then defines some metadata about the tool, including its type ("numeric") and the weather element it edits ("WaveHeight"). It also imports the numpy library, which suggests that the tool involves numerical computations.

The script then provides commented-out code for setting up a list of elements to screen and variables to solicit from the user. This could be used to customize the tool's behavior based on user input or specific use cases.

The main part of the script defines a Python class called `Tool`, which inherits from a class called `SmartScript`. This class has an `execute` method that takes two arguments, `WindWaveHgt` and `Swell`. This method calculates the `WaveHeight` by adding `WindWaveHgt` and the first element of `Swell`, and then returns this value. This suggests that the tool calculates wave height based on wind wave height and swell.

The script also includes commented-out code for optional methods and error handling, as well as some explanatory comments about Python concepts like `self` and method definitions. These could be useful for developers who are modifying or extending the tool.</p>
