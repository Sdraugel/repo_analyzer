                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>The code defines a Python class named `GetASCIIGridsRequest`. This class is likely used to represent a request to get ASCII grids from a database. The class has several attributes: `databaseIds`, `parmIds`, `timeRange`, `coordConversionString`, `workstationID`, and `siteID`. All of these attributes are initialized as `None` in the `__init__` method, which is the constructor of the class.

The class also includes getter and setter methods for each attribute. Getter methods return the current value of the attribute, and setter methods set a new value for the attribute.

Here is a brief description of the attributes:

- `databaseIds`: This could represent the IDs of the databases from which the ASCII grids are to be fetched.
- `parmIds`: This could represent parameter IDs needed for the request.
- `timeRange`: This could represent the time range for which the ASCII grids are requested.
- `coordConversionString`: This could represent a string used for coordinate conversion.
- `workstationID`: This could represent the ID of the workstation from which the request is made.
- `siteID`: This could represent the ID of the site for which the ASCII grids are requested.

The initial comment block is a legal disclaimer and information about the software's development and export control. It mentions that the software was developed and/or modified by Raytheon Company under a US Government contract and contains export-restricted data.
