                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This Python code is part of a larger software developed by Raytheon Company. It is a script that creates a Graphical User Interface (GUI) dialog box using the tkinter library, which is a standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit. 

The code defines two classes, `Dialog` and `IFPDialog`. 

The `Dialog` class is a subclass of `tkinter.simpledialog.Dialog` and it initializes a dialog box. It has a constructor method (`__init__`) that sets up the dialog box's properties such as its parent widget, title, position, and whether it should wait for user interaction before proceeding. The `ctorHook` method is a placeholder for additional initialization code that subclasses can override.

The `IFPDialog` class is a subclass of the `Dialog` class. Its constructor method also accepts a `constructionHook` argument, which is a function that gets called in the `ctorHook` method. This allows for additional customization of the dialog box at construction time.

The code also contains a comment block at the top that provides information about the software's licensing and export restrictions, as well as the contractor's name and address.</p>
