                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>The provided code is a Python script that appears to be part of a testing suite for a software developed by Raytheon Company. The script defines a class `MockHazardUtils` that inherits from `HazardUtils`. This class is intended to allow `HazardUtils` to be tested by overriding some of its methods with methods that return dummy objects. 

Here are the main parts of the code:

1. Importing necessary modules: The script imports `HazardUtils` and `MockParm`. `HazardUtils` is likely a utility class for handling hazards, and `MockParm` is likely a mock class for testing.

2. `MockHazardUtils` class: This class is a mock class for testing `HazardUtils`. It overrides several methods from `HazardUtils` to return dummy data or perform dummy operations. These methods include `getGridInfo`, `getGrids`, `getParm`, `getGridShape`, and `createGrid`. The purpose of these methods is to bypass the use of the parm manager, which is likely a component that manages parameters in the actual software.

3. `__dumpParms` method: This private method is used to dump names and values of all parameters to the log. It is used within the `createGrid` method to log the parameters passed to it.

The code also contains a header with information about the software's development, contractor details, and export control restrictions.

This code appears to be part of a larger Python class, and it includes several methods that perform various tasks:

1. `__dumpArgs(self, *args)`: This method logs the arguments passed to it. It checks the type of each argument and formats it accordingly before writing it to the log. If the argument is a byte string, it's written with single quotes around it. If it's a tuple, the method is called recursively for each element of the tuple, and the results are written with parentheses around them. If the argument has a `shape` attribute (which suggests it's a numpy array), its type and shape are written to the log. Any other type of argument is written to the log as is. After the first argument, a comma and a space are written before each subsequent argument.

2. `getDiscreteKeys(self, element)`: This method returns the value associated with the given element in the `discreteKeys` dictionary, or `None` if the element is not in the dictionary.

3. `loadedParms(self)`: This method returns a list of 3-tuples. Each tuple's first element is a key from the `parms` dictionary, and the second and third elements are always the strings 'SFC' and 'Fcst'. This suggests that the `parms` dictionary represents some sort of parameters related to forecasting, but the method doesn't use the values of the dictionary, only the keys.

4. `statusBarMsg(self, message, status, category="GFE")`: This method writes a formatted message to the log. It first checks that the `message` and `status` arguments are not `None` and that `status` is one of the strings 'A', 'R', 'U', or 'S'. If any of these checks fail, it raises a `RuntimeError`. If the `log` attribute is not `None`, it writes a string to the log that includes the `message`, `status`, and `category` arguments.

The code also includes a few lines at the top that seem to be part of another method, but it's not clear what that method does without seeing the rest of it.</p>
