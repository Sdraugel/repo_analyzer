                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This Python code file appears to be part of a larger software system developed by Raytheon Company, as indicated by the header comments. The code is subject to U.S. export control laws due to containing potentially sensitive technical data.

The main purpose of this code is to define an adapter for handling `java.nio.ByteBuffer` and `java.nio.HeapByteBuffer` objects. These are classes from Java's New I/O (NIO) package, used for handling data buffers. The adapter is represented as a Python list named `ClassAdapter`.

Two methods are defined: `serialize` and `deserialize`. 

The `serialize` method is intended to convert a ByteBuffer into a format that can be stored or transmitted. However, the method is not implemented and will raise a `NotImplementedError` if called. This suggests that the serialization of ByteBuffers is not supported in this context.

The `deserialize` method reads binary data from the context and returns it. This method is used to convert data from its binary form into a ByteBuffer.

The `SOFTWARE HISTORY` section in the comments indicates that this code was initially created on August 3, 2011, by an engineer named "dgilling".</p>
