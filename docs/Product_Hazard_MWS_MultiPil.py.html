                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This Python script appears to be part of a larger system developed by Raytheon Company for the US Government, likely related to weather forecasting given the references to marine weather statements and hazards. The script is subject to US export control laws due to containing potentially sensitive data.

The script defines a class `TextProduct` that inherits from a `GenericHazards.TextProduct` class. This class is used to generate a text-based weather report for marine conditions. It has several configuration items that can be customized, such as the product name, station ID, WMO ID, and other identifiers. It also has optional configuration items that can be set to customize the output further.

The `TextProduct` class has a method `allowedHazards` that defines the types of marine hazards that can be included in the report. The `_makeProduct` method is responsible for generating the actual text of the report. It creates a headline for the report, generates the body text based on the list of hazards, and then formats the text for output.

The script also includes some information about the contractor (Raytheon Company) and its address. It mentions a "Master Rights File.pdf" which likely contains further information about licensing and usage rights.</p>
