                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This Python code is part of a software developed or modified by Raytheon Company, as per a contract with the US Government. The software contains export-restricted data and its export/transfer/disclosure is restricted by U.S. law.

The code file is a base file that is not intended to be overridden, but it can be subclassed to override behavior. It's part of the GFE (Graphical Forecast Editor) system and is related to the Smart Initialization Configuration.

The code was updated by Joe Maloney on 2016-07-18 for the nwpsCG1AFG model, which is a specific model used in weather forecasting.

The code imports modules from two other Python files: 'Init' and 'nwpsCG1'. It then defines a new class 'nwpsCG1AFGForecaster' that inherits from the 'nwpsCG1Forecaster' class defined in the 'nwpsCG1' module.

The 'nwpsCG1AFGForecaster' class has an initializer method that calls the initializer of its superclass with specific parameters. 

The 'main' function creates an instance of the 'nwpsCG1AFGForecaster' class, runs it, and then sends a notification to the GFE system.

Finally, there is a conditional statement that checks if this script is the main program being run (as opposed to being imported as a module), and if so, it calls the 'main' function.</p>
