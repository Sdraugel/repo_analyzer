                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This code is a Python implementation of a simplified version of the `java.util.GregorianCalendar` class. It is part of a software developed and/or modified by Raytheon Company, under a contract with the US Government. The software contains export-restricted data, and its export/transfer/disclosure is restricted by U.S. law.

The Python class `Calendar` has the following features:

- An instance variable `time` which is initialized as `None` in the constructor (`__init__` method).
- A static method `getInstance` that returns a new instance of `GregorianCalendar`. This method mimics the `getInstance` method in `java.util.Calendar`, which returns a `Calendar` object whose calendar fields have been initialized with the current date and time.
- A method `getTimeInMillis` that returns the value of the `time` instance variable. This method is similar to the `getTimeInMillis` method in `java.util.Calendar` that returns the current time in milliseconds.
- A method `setTimeInMillis` that sets the value of the `time` instance variable. This method is similar to the `setTimeInMillis` method in `java.util.Calendar` that sets the calendar's time with the given amount in milliseconds.

The code also contains a software history comment section that records the date, ticket number, engineer, and description of changes made to the code. The initial creation was done by an engineer named `wldougher` on `09/29/10`.</p>
