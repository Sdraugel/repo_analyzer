                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This Python code is part of a larger software developed by Raytheon Company. It is subject to U.S. export control laws and contains export-restricted data. The software was developed under a contract with the US Government.

The code is a base file that is not intended to be overridden, but it can be subclassed to override behavior. It is related to the Smart Initialization Configuration section of the GFE Online Help.

The specific part of the code provided is for a module that calculates surface weather elements from the nwpsCG1 model output. It was developed by Joe Maloney in 2016.

The code defines a class `nwpsCG1LOXForecaster` which is a subclass of `nwpsCG1Forecaster` from the `nwpsCG1` module. The class has an initialization method that calls the initialization method of the superclass with specific parameters.

The `main` function creates an instance of `nwpsCG1LOXForecaster`, runs it, and then sends a notification to GFE with a specific message.

The last two lines of the code ensure that the `main` function is run when the Python file is executed as a script.</p>
