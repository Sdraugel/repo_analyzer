                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>The provided code defines a Python class named `MergeActiveTableRequest`. This class seems to be part of a larger software system developed by Raytheon Company, as indicated by the comments at the top of the file.

The `MergeActiveTableRequest` class represents a request to merge active tables in a database or similar data structure. It has several attributes:

- `incomingRecords`: A list of records to be merged into the active table.
- `tableName`: The name of the table where the records will be merged. It can be either 'OPERATIONAL' or 'PRACTICE', and it defaults to 'PRACTICE'.
- `site`: The site where the operation is performed. It doesn't have a default value.
- `timeOffset`: A time offset for the operation, defaulting to 0.0.
- `xmlSource`: The source of the XML data for the operation. It doesn't have a default value.
- `fromIngestAT`: A boolean indicating whether the operation is from Ingest Active Table. It defaults to False.
- `makeBackups`: A boolean indicating whether backups should be made during the operation. It defaults to True.

The class also includes a `__repr__` method for creating a string representation of an instance of the class and a `__str__` method that returns the same string representation.

In addition, the class provides getter and setter methods for all its attributes. The setter for `tableName` includes a check to ensure the table name is either 'OPERATIONAL' or 'PRACTICE', raising a `ValueError` if it's not. The setters for `timeOffset`, `fromIngestAT`, and `makeBackups` also ensure the input values are converted to the correct types (float and boolean, respectively).</p>
