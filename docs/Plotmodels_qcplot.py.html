                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This code defines a Python class named `QCReport` which seems to be used for generating some sort of quality control report. 

The class has several class attributes defined at the top such as `VALIDITY_BIT`, `INTERNAL_BIT`, `TEMPORAL_BIT`, `STATISTICAL_BIT`, `SPATIAL_BIT`, `KALMAN_BIT`, `FILL`, `ROW_HEADERS`, and `CHECK_MASKS`. These attributes seem to be used as constants throughout the class.

The `__init__` method is the constructor of the class which initializes the instance with several attributes such as `baseParamNames`, `headers`, `checks`, `tlCornerParameter`, `pdv`, `tableText`, `subjectiveMap`, and `title`.

The class also has several methods:

- `setTitle`: This method sets the title of the report.
- `setPointDataView`: This method sets the point data view (`pdv`) of the report and resets `tableText` and `failed`.
- `getPointDataView`: This method returns the point data view (`pdv`) of the report.
- `getTableText`: This method generates the text of the table for the report. It uses the `baseParamNames` to get quality control data from the `pdv`, formats it into a string, and stores it in `tableText`. It also determines whether the report has failed or not.
- `isOk`: This method returns whether the report is okay (i.e., not failed).
- `isFailed`: This method returns whether the report has failed.

The comments at the top of the code indicate that this software was developed by Raytheon Company and contains export-restricted data. It also mentions that this is a base file that is not intended to be overridden.</p>
