    "summary": "The term 'qpid' is used in the context of various Python scripts and refers to Qpid, a cross-platform, open-source messaging system. \n\n1. In a script designed to update a JSON file before installing Qpid SSL certificates onto hosts, Qpid is referenced as part of the data update process in the `state.json` file's content. Specifically, it alters the `location_specs` attribute of certain targets in the file to include a path synonymous with Qpid messaging system activity.\n\n2. Qpid Proton library is used in a script for managing the connection to a broker to send notifications about data transaction acknowledgments. This informs EDEX, a data exchange system, of any ACKs (acknowledgments) or NACKs (negative acknowledgments) received from the Message Handling System (MHS).\n\n3. QPID broker is used in a script for sending files to EDEX for ingestion. The script defines a class `EdexQpidIngest` to connect to the QPID server and send the designated files. \n\n4. Qpid is a notable part of a Python interface that listens to Graphical Forecast Editor (GFE) notifications. Here, a Qpid message broker is used to receive messages from a specific topic. \n\n5. Finally, Qpid is employed in a script that listens as well as prints site activation messages. The script uses a Qpid Subscriber object for managing the connection and subscribing to specific topics where the activation messages are posted.",

            "description": "This Python script is used to update a JSON file named `state.json` located in the `/etc/pki/a2pgca/state/` directory. This update is done before installing Qpid SSL certificates onto `cpsbn1` and `cpsbn2`.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of what the script does:\n\n1. It opens the `state.json` file in read and write mode (`r+`).\n\n2. It reads the content of the file and loads it into a Python dictionary using the `json.load()` function. The loaded data is stored in the variable `data`.\n\n3. It then iterates over the items in the `targets` list in the `data` dictionary. For each `target` in the `targets` list, it checks if the `name` attribute of the `target` is `'cp1f'` and the `type` attribute is `'server'`. \n\n4. If both conditions are met, it updates the `location_specs` attribute of the `target` to be `['server:$PX_SERVERS:/awips2/qpid']`.\n\n5. After updating the `data` dictionary, it moves the file pointer back to the beginning of the file using `f.seek(0)`.\n\n6. It then writes the updated `data` back to the `state.json` file in a pretty-printed format (with an indentation of 4 spaces) using the `json.dump()` function.\n\n7. Finally, it truncates the rest of the file from the current file position (which is at the end of the written data) using `f.truncate()`. This is done to remove any old data that might still be present in the file after the new data has been written."

            "description": "The provided code is a Python script that is responsible for notifying EDEX (a data exchange system) about an ACK (acknowledgement) or NACK (negative acknowledgement) from MHS (Message Handling System). \n\nThe script primarily consists of three classes: `MhsAckNotification`, `MhsAckException`, and `MhsAckConnection`. \n\n- `MhsAckNotification` is a simple class that holds the details of a notification, including the message ID, sender, and response (either ACK or NACK). \n\n- `MhsAckException` is a custom exception class that is used to handle exceptions related to broker communication.\n\n- `MhsAckConnection` is a class that manages the connection to the broker. It includes methods for sending a message and closing the connection. The connection uses the Qpid Proton library for messaging, and it supports SSL connections.\n\nThe script also includes a `run` function, which is the main function of the script. This function gets the message ID, response, and sender from command line arguments, removes the corresponding .doc file from the MHS data directory, and sends a notification to the broker. The function uses a time limit for connecting to the broker and sending the notification to ensure that these operations do not take too long.\n\nThe script uses the `logging` module to log information, warnings, and errors. The log messages include the process ID, timestamp, log level, and message. The logger is named 'mhsAckNotify'.\n\nThis code is a part of a Python script that is designed to be run as a standalone program. \n\nThe `if __name__ == '__main__':` line checks if this script is being run directly (not being imported as a module in another script). If it is being run directly, it will call the `run()` function.\n\nThe `sys.exit(run())` line is used to exit from Python. The integer value returned by the `run()` function is used as the exit status. In Unix, a 0 exit status usually means that the program finished successfully, while a non-zero status indicates an error.\n\nThe `log.exception(f\"Failed to send notification [{notif}].\")` line is logging an exception message. This is typically done in a try/except block where an error might occur. The `notif` variable is included in the message to provide context about which notification failed to send.\n\nThe `return 1` line is used to return an error status (in this case, 1) when an exception occurs, indicating that the program did not finish successfully."

            "description": "This script is a command-line tool for sending files to EDEX for ingestion using the QPID broker. EDEX is a data exchange system, and QPID is a messaging system that provides reliable message delivery.\n\nThe script starts by importing necessary modules and setting up logging. It then defines a regular expression to match WMO headers in the data.\n\nThe `EdexQpidIngest` class is defined with methods to get message headers from the data, start a connection to the QPID server, and send files to EDEX for ingestion. The `startConnection` method retrieves the QPID server hostname from the environment variables and establishes a connection. The `sendToIngest` method logs the number of files to be sent, waits for 5 seconds, and then attempts to send each file to EDEX via the QPID broker. If any errors occur during this process, they are logged and counted.\n\nThe `parseArgs` function is used to parse command-line arguments. It expects one or more file paths to be provided. If only one argument is provided and it contains commas, it is split into multiple file paths.\n\nThe `main` function parses the command-line arguments, logs them, and creates an instance of the `EdexQpidIngest` class. It then attempts to start a connection to the QPID broker within a 10-second time limit. If the connection fails or times out, an error is logged and the script exits with a status code of 1.\n\nThis Python script is designed to send files to a destination, presumably for data ingestion, and it has a built-in time limit for this process. Here's a breakdown of what the code does:\n\n1. `s.exit(1)`: This line is trying to call the `exit` function from an undefined object `s`. This will likely cause an error unless `s` is defined elsewhere in the code.\n\n2. The `try` block: The script attempts to execute the `sendToIngest` method of an object `m` with `args.files` as an argument. This method is expected to send files somewhere for ingestion. The `with time_limit(10):` line suggests that this process is given a maximum of 10 seconds to complete.\n\n3. The `except TimeoutException:` block: If the `sendToIngest` method does not complete within the 10-second time limit, a `TimeoutException` is raised. The script then logs an error message \"Failed to send files within timeout period.\" and exits with a status code of 1, indicating an error occurred.\n\n4. The `except Exception:` block: If any other kind of exception is raised during the execution of the `sendToIngest` method, the script logs the exception with the message \"Failed to send files.\" and exits with a status code of 1.\n\n5. `if __name__ == '__main__': main()`: This is a common Python idiom. If this script is being run directly (as opposed to being imported as a module), it calls a function named `main`. This `main` function is not defined in the provided code, but it presumably contains the setup and function calls necessary for the script to accomplish its task."

            "description": "This Python script is part of a larger software system developed by Raytheon Company. It provides a Python-based interface for listening to GFE (Graphical Forecast Editor) notifications.\n\nThe script imports several modules and libraries, including time, sys, threading, collections, dynamicserialize, and QpidSubscriber from awips. \n\nThe script defines several classes and functions:\n\n1. `GetGfeNotifyTopicListener` class: This is a thread that listens to a specific topic on a Qpid message broker. It receives messages, deserializes them, and adds them to a message queue based on their type.\n\n2. `decodeOptions` function: This function processes command-line options passed to the script. It uses the getopt module to parse the options and returns a dictionary mapping option names to their values.\n\n3. `usage` function: This function prints usage information for the script. It's called if the script is invoked with invalid command-line options.\n\n4. `printLoop` function: This function runs in an infinite loop, printing the number of messages in each queue every 3 seconds. If a command-line option is set, it also prints the messages in the corresponding queue.\n\nThe script also defines several dictionaries and lists:\n\n1. `printoutMap` and `classMap`: These dictionaries map codes to notification types and notification types to codes, respectively.\n\n2. `topicList`: This list contains the names of the topics that the script listens to.\n\n3. `messageQueueMap`: This dictionary maps codes to lists of messages. Each list is a queue of messages of a specific type.\n\nThe script is designed to be run from the command line with various options that control its behavior.\n\nThis code is written in Python and appears to be part of a larger program that listens for notifications on various topics. \n\nThe first part of the code snippet removes an object from a map (dictionary) where the keys are letters and the values are lists. If the list for a given letter is empty, it sets the value for that letter in the map to an empty list. It then flushes the output buffer. If a KeyboardInterrupt exception is raised, it is silently ignored.\n\nThe `main` function first prints a message indicating that it is a diagnostic program for getting notifications. It then decodes some options (the details of which are not included in the provided code). If the options are not None, it creates a list of threads. For each topic in a list of topics (which is not defined in the provided code), it creates a new `GetGfeNotifyTopicListener` thread with the options and topic name, and adds it to the list of threads.\n\nIt then starts each thread in the list of threads and calls a function `printLoop` with the options. If any exception is raised during this process, it will stop all the threads in the list of threads.\n\nThe last part of the code checks if this script is the main module being run (as opposed to being imported by another script). If it is the main module, it calls the `main` function."

It also initializes a QpidSubscriber object to None and calls the __init__ method of the superclass.\n\nThe run method is where the thread's activity is defined. It creates a QpidSubscriber object with the provided host, port, and program parameters, and subscribes to a topic with a callback function receivedMessage.\n\nThe stop method is used to close the QpidSubscriber connection.\n\nThe receivedMessage method is the callback function that is called when a message is received. It deserializes the received message and prints it along with the current date and time. If the type of the deserialized object is ClusterActivationNotification, it stops the thread.\n\nThe script also contains a software history, which documents changes made to the script over time."
