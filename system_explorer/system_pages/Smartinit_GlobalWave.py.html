                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This Python code appears to be part of a larger software system, possibly related to weather forecasting. It is developed or modified by Raytheon Company under a contract with the US Government. The software contains export-restricted data, meaning it cannot be disseminated to non-U.S. persons without an export license or other authorization.

The code itself is a base file that is not intended to be overridden, but can be subclassed to change its behavior. It imports two modules, `Init` and `WW3`, which are likely other parts of the same software system.

The code then defines a class `GlobalWaveForecaster` which inherits from `WW3Forecaster` class defined in the `WW3` module. The `GlobalWaveForecaster` class has an `__init__` method that initializes an instance of the class with the name "GlobalWave".

Finally, the `main` function is defined to create an instance of `GlobalWaveForecaster` and run it. This function is probably the entry point of the program, which means it's the first function that gets executed when the program starts.</p>
