                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>The provided code is a Python script that defines a class called `EditAreaUtils`. This class provides utilities for dealing with Edit Areas in a software developed by Raytheon Company. The class inherits from `TextUtils.TextUtils`, indicating it likely deals with text manipulation or analysis related to these Edit Areas.

The class `EditAreaUtils` has several methods:

1. `__init__`: This is the constructor method that initializes the class instance. It sets up a logger and some initial values.

2. `setUp`: This method is used to set up the instance with a parameter name and level, and an argument dictionary. It seems to be used for intersections and unions.

3. `getIFPClient`: This method returns the `__ifpClient` attribute of the instance.

4. `getGridLoc`: This method returns the `__gridLoc` attribute of the instance.

5. `getAreaList`: This method returns the list of edit areas and display names for the product from the argument dictionary.

6. `currentAreaContains`: This method checks if the current edit area intersects with any of the areas listed in the areaNameList.

7. `currentAreaConsistsOf`: This method checks if the current edit area consists exclusively of areas listed in the areaNameList.

8. `getEditAreas`: This method returns the ReferenceArea given a name or ReferenceID or ReferenceData.

9. `getEditArea`: This method returns an AFPS.ReferenceData object given an edit area name as defined in the GFE.

10. `createLatLonArea`: This method creates a square edit area given a latitude, longitude, and kilometer dimension for the sides.

The code also imports several modules and classes, likely used within the `EditAreaUtils` class. These include `time`, `math`, `logging`, `TextUtils`, `ReferenceData`, `ReferenceID`, `Grid2DBit`, and `ArrayList`.

The code appears to be part of a larger Python class that is dealing with geographical data, specifically grid-based data. It includes several methods for manipulating and analyzing this data. Here's a breakdown of what each method does:

1. `getLatLonAreaName(self, latLonTuple)`: This method generates a name for a given latitude and longitude area. It takes a tuple of latitude, longitude, and dimension, and returns a string that concatenates these values with "Ref" as a prefix.

2. `makeSquare(self, lat, lon, km)`: This method creates a list of points that form a square of a given size around a specific latitude and longitude. The size of the square is specified in kilometers.

3. `makePoint(self, point)`: This method converts a string representation of a point in the format "x,y" into a Coordinate object.

4. `makeArea(self, pointList, refname=None)`: This method creates a Reference Area with a unique ReferenceID. It takes a list of points and optionally a reference name.

5. `getTime(self)`: This method returns a string representation of the current time without spaces or colons.

6. `getIntersectName(self, areaName, localEffectArea)`: This method generates a name for an intersection area.

7. `inQuery(self, tree, areaName, queryStr)`: This method checks if a given area name is part of an intersection.

8. `unionAreas(self, name, area1, area2)`: This method combines two areas (ReferenceData objects) using a logical OR operation and returns a new ReferenceData object.

9. `intersectAreas(self, name, area1, area2)`: This method finds the intersection of two areas (ReferenceData objects) using a logical AND operation and returns a new ReferenceData object.

10. `getCurrentAreaNames(self, tree, areaName=None)`: This method returns the current list of area names being processed. If a Combinations file is being used, there may be multiple names in the list. Otherwise, it will be a list of one edit area name.

The code that was cut off seems to be part of another method, but without the rest of the code, it's hard to say what it does.

This code defines a set of methods in a class that interact with an object called `IFPClient` to manipulate and manage areas. Here's a breakdown of what each method does:

1. `saveEditAreas(self, editAreas)`: This method takes a list of `editAreas` as input, adds them to a Java ArrayList, and then saves this list of areas using the `saveReferenceData` method of the `IFPClient` object.

2. `getComboNumber(self)`: This method increments the `__comboNumber` attribute of the class by 1 and returns the new value. 

3. `getUnion(self, argDict, areaLabels, areaPrefix)`: This method creates a union of areas. It iterates over `areaLabels`, gets the corresponding area using the `getEditArea` method, and then combines these areas using the `unionAreas` method. The union is labeled with a combination of `areaPrefix`, the current time, and the combo number. 

4. `cleanOutEditAreas(self, areaPrefix)`: This method deletes all areas that start with a given `areaPrefix`. It gets a list of all areas from the `IFPClient` object, checks if their names start with the `areaPrefix`, and if they do, it adds them to a list. This list is then passed to the `deleteEditAreas` method for deletion.

5. `deleteEditAreas(self, editAreas)`: This method deletes a list of areas. It accepts a list of areas, which can be either strings, `ReferenceData` objects, or `ReferenceID` objects. It adds the IDs of these areas to a Java ArrayList and then deletes them using the `deleteReferenceData` method of the `IFPClient` object.

The code seems to be part of a larger system that manages geographical or spatial data, possibly for a weather or geographical information system.</p>
