                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This Python script appears to be part of a larger software system developed by Raytheon Company for the US Government, as indicated by the comments at the top of the file. The software is subject to US export controls.

The script seems to be a configuration file for a weather-related application, possibly related to the Advanced Weather Interactive Processing System (AWIPS II) as suggested by the reference to the "AWIPS II Master Rights File".

The script imports from a module named `gfeConfig`, which presumably contains some configuration settings or functions needed by this script.

The script then defines several variables related to the generation of an image:

- `Png_parms` is set to a list containing a single string, 'T_SFC:_Official -1'. This might be a parameter for the image generation, possibly related to temperature at the surface ('T_SFC').

- `Png_image` is set to 'T', which might indicate that the image to be generated should represent temperature.

- `States_graphicColor` and `States_lineWidth` are set to 'red' and 3, respectively. These might be settings for the appearance of state boundaries on the image.

- `CWA_graphicColor` and `CWA_linePattern` are set to 'green' and 'DOTTED', respectively. These might be settings for the appearance of County Warning Areas (CWAs) on the image.</p>
