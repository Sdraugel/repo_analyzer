                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This Python script is part of a larger software system developed by Raytheon Company. It is designed to create combination files specific to a site, a process that has been partially ported from a previous version of the software (AWIPS-I).

The script begins by importing several Python modules that it needs to function, such as glob (for file path handling), os (for interacting with the operating system), pprint (for pretty-printing Python data structures), stat (for interpreting status codes), and tempfile (for creating temporary files). It also imports a custom module named LogStream, which is presumably used for logging events and errors.

The main function in this script is `createComboFiles(definitionDir, outputDir, mapDict)`. This function takes three arguments: a directory containing definition files, an output directory where the combination files will be written, and a dictionary mapping names to data.

The function works as follows:

1. It logs the definition directory and then uses the glob module to get a list of all Python files in that directory that end with 'Definition.py'.

2. For each of these files, it tries to open the file and read its contents into a buffer. If it encounters an error (e.g., the file doesn't exist or can't be read), it logs the problem and moves on to the next file.

3. It then tries to execute the contents of the buffer as Python code, which should define a dictionary named 'Definition'. If this fails (e.g., because the file doesn't contain valid Python code or doesn't define a 'Definition' dictionary), it logs the problem and moves on to the next file.

4. It then checks whether the 'Definition' dictionary contains certain keys and whether the values associated with those keys are of the expected types. If so, it uses this information to generate a combination file, which it writes to the output directory.

5. If it encounters any errors while writing the combination file, it logs the problem.

This script also includes a significant amount of logging code, which records various events and errors that might occur during its execution. This can be useful for debugging and troubleshooting.</p>
