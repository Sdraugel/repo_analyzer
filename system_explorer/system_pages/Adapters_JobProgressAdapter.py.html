                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This Python script is an adapter for the `JobProgress` class from the `com.raytheon.uf.common.dataplugin.gfe.svcbu` package. The adapter provides two main functions: `serialize` and `deserialize`.

The `serialize` function takes a `context` and a `mode` as arguments. The `context` is likely an object that provides a protocol for serialization. The `mode` is the object to be serialized. The function begins writing a field to the protocol with the name '__enumValue__', a type of `TType.STRING`, and an id of 0. It then writes the value of the `mode` object to the protocol as a string.

The `deserialize` function also takes a `context` as an argument. It creates a new `JobProgress` object and reads a field from the protocol. This field is expected to be a string with the name '__enumValue__'. The function discards the field name, type, and id, and only keeps the actual value, which it reads as a string and assigns to the `value` attribute of the `JobProgress` object. The function then returns the `JobProgress` object.

The script also contains a software history log, which shows that the initial creation of this part of the code was done by an engineer named 'randerso' on 06/22/2015.

The comments at the top of the file indicate that the software was developed and/or modified by Raytheon Company under a contract with the US Government. The software contains export-restricted data, and its export/transfer/disclosure is restricted by U.S. law.</p>
