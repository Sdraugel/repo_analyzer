                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This Python code file is part of a software developed or modified by Raytheon Company under a contract with the US Government. The software contains export-restricted data, and its export or transfer is controlled by U.S. law.

The code itself is a base file that is not intended to be overridden, but it can be subclassed to override behavior. It is part of the Smart Initialization Configuration section of the GFE Online Help.

The code is named "nwpsTrkngCG0PHI" and was created by Joe Maloney on July 8, 2016. It is a Smart Init for the nwpsTrkngCG0PHI model.

The code imports two modules: Init and nwpsTrkngCG0. It then defines a class named "nwpsTrkngCG0PHIForecaster" which is a subclass of "nwpsTrkngCG0Forecaster". This class has an initialization method that calls the initialization method of the parent class with two parameters: "nwpsTrkngCG0PHI" and "nwpsTrkngCG0PHI".

The main function of the code creates an instance of the "nwpsTrkngCG0PHIForecaster" class, runs it, and then notifies the GFE with 'PHI'. 

The main function is executed if the Python file is run as a script.</p>
