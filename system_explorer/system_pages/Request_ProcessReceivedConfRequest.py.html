                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This Python code defines a class named `ProcessReceivedConfRequest`. This class appears to be a data model or a data holder that represents some sort of configuration request that has been received. 

The class has three attributes: `receivedConfFile`, `workstationID`, and `siteID`. All these attributes are initialized as `None` in the constructor method `__init__`.

There are getter and setter methods for each of these attributes. The getter methods (`getReceivedConfFile`, `getWorkstationID`, `getSiteID`) return the current value of the respective attribute. The setter methods (`setReceivedConfFile`, `setWorkstationID`, `setSiteID`) set the value of the respective attribute.
