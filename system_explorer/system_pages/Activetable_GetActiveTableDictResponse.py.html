                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>The given code is written in Python and it defines a class named `GetActiveTableDictResponse`. This class has two attributes: `activeTable` and `mode`, both of which are initialized as `None` in the constructor method `__init__`.

The class provides getter and setter methods for these two attributes. The getter methods (`getActiveTable` and `getMode`) return the current values of the attributes, while the setter methods (`setActiveTable` and `setMode`) allow you to set new values for these attributes.

The initial comment block at the top of the code is a legal disclaimer and copyright notice from Raytheon Company. It states that the software was developed or modified by Raytheon Company under a specific contract with the US Government. It also mentions that the software contains export-restricted data and its export/transfer/disclosure is restricted by U.S. law. The contractor's name, address, and contact information are provided, and it is noted that further licensing information can be found in the "AWIPS II Master Rights File".

The comment "File auto-generated against equivalent DynamicSerialize Java class" suggests that this Python file was automatically generated to have the same functionality as a corresponding Java class in the DynamicSerialize system.</p>
