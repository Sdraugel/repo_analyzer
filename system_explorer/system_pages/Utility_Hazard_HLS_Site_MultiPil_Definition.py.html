                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This code is a configuration file for a software product developed by Raytheon Company. It provides settings for a product definition override for a formatter named "Hazard_HLS". 

The file starts with a legal notice, stating that the software was developed under a specific contract with the US Government. It also mentions that the software contains export-restricted data and requires an export license or other authorization for dissemination to non-U.S. persons.

The file then provides the contractor's name and address, and refers to a document called "AWIPS II Master Rights File" for further licensing information. It also states that the software is in the public domain, provided "as is", without technical support or warranty.

The code then sets up a dictionary called "Definition", which is used to store configuration items for the Hazard_HLS formatter. It specifies that no changes should be made to the initial definition of this dictionary.

The code then provides a series of configuration items, some of which are required and some of which are optional. The required items include the display name, full station ID, WMO ID, product PIL, textdbPil, awipsWANPil, and output file. The optional items include the source database and a debug flag.

The code also includes a placeholder for a list of override variables, but this list is currently empty.</p>
