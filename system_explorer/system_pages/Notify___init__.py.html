                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This part of the code file appears to be a Python module that imports two classes, `ClusterActivationNotification` and `SiteActivationNotification`, from the current package (indicated by the dot before the class names). These classes are then added to the `__all__` variable, which defines the public interface of the module. This means that when a client imports this module using the statement `from module import *`, only the items in `__all__` are imported.

The comments at the top of the file provide legal information related to the software's development and usage.
