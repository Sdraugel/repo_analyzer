                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>The provided code is written in Python and it defines a class named `DQCPreProcessorExecuteRequest`. 

The class has a constructor method (`__init__`) that initializes an instance variable `runConfig` to `None`. 

There are two methods in the class: `getRunConfig` and `setRunConfig`. The `getRunConfig` method is a getter method that returns the value of the `runConfig` instance variable. The `setRunConfig` method is a setter method that takes an argument `runConfig` and sets the instance variable `runConfig` to the value of the argument.

The comments at the top of the code indicate that this software was developed and/or modified by Raytheon Company under a contract with the US Government. The software contains export-restricted data, and its export/transfer/disclosure is restricted by U.S. law. 

The file appears to be auto-generated against an equivalent DynamicSerialize Java class. There's a software history log that shows the file was generated by an engineer named smanoj on January 28, 2019.</p>
