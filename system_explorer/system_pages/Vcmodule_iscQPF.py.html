                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This Python code seems to be part of a larger software system developed by Raytheon Company. The code defines a class named `VCParm` which appears to be used for handling and manipulating time ranges (possibly related to weather forecasting data, as suggested by the variables `QPF` and `QPF_ISC`).

The `VCParm` class has several methods:

1. `splitTR(self, tr, inv)`: This method splits a given time range (`tr`) based on overlaps with a list of other time ranges (`inv`). It returns a list of time ranges that do not overlap with any time range in `inv`.

2. `tcmp(self, t1, t2)`: This method compares two time ranges based on their starting times.

3. `getInventory(self, QPF, QPF_ISC)`: This method takes two lists of time ranges (`QPF` and `QPF_ISC`) and returns a list of tuples, each containing a time range and two lists of overlapping time ranges from `QPF` and `QPF_ISC` respectively.

4. `poverlap(self, tr1, tr2)`: This method calculates the percentage of overlap between two time ranges.

5. `calcGrid(self, QPF, QPF_ISC)`: This method calculates a grid based on the overlap between the time ranges in `QPF` and `QPF_ISC`.

6. `calcHistory(self, QPF_ISC)`: This method returns a list of all time ranges in `QPF_ISC`.

7. `getWEInfo(self)`: This method returns a tuple of information, possibly related to weather forecasting.

8. `_containsTR(self, tr1, tr2)`, `_contains(self, timerange, time)`, `_overlaps(self, tr1, tr2)`, and `_intersect(self, t1, t2)`: These are helper methods used for checking if a time range contains another time range or a specific time, if two time ranges overlap, and for finding the intersection of two time ranges.

The code also imports the `numpy` library and defines several constants at the beginning.</p>
