                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This is a Python script that is part of a larger software package developed or modified by Raytheon Company under a contract with the US Government. The script includes a legal notice stating that the software contains export-restricted data and its dissemination to non-U.S. persons requires an export license or other authorization.

The script also includes the contractor's name and address, and a reference to a document called "AWIPS II Master Rights File" for further licensing information.

The script then defines a package for `java.awt`, which is a common package in Java for creating user interfaces. However, it's unusual to see it in a Python script, suggesting that this might be part of a larger system that integrates Python and Java.

The software history section records that the initial creation of this part of the software was done by an engineer named 'njensen' on 08/31/10.

The `__all__` variable is a list that defines the public interface of the module. It specifies that only the 'Point' class should be imported when a client imports this module using the `from module import *` syntax.

The last line of the script imports the 'Point' class from a module in the same package named 'Point'.</p>
