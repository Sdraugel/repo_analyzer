                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This Python script is a part of a software developed by Raytheon Company under a contract with the US Government. The software contains export-restricted data, and its export or transfer is controlled by US law.

The script defines a module that calculates surface weather elements from the output of the nwpsTrkngCG0 model. The module is defined in a class named `nwpsTrkngCG0KEYForecaster` which is a subclass of `nwpsTrkngCG0Forecaster`. 

The `nwpsTrkngCG0KEYForecaster` class has an `__init__` method that initializes an instance of the class with the name "nwpsTrkngCG0KEY". 

The `main` function creates an instance of the `nwpsTrkngCG0KEYForecaster` class, runs the forecaster, and then sends a notification to GFE with the message 'KEY'.

The script is designed to be run as a standalone program. If the script is run directly (not imported as a module), the `main` function is called due to the `if __name__ == "__main__":` line. 

The comments in the script also mention that this is a base file that is not intended to be overridden, but can be subclassed to override behavior. It also mentions a specific model, `nwpsTrkngCG0KEY`, and a developer, Joe Maloney, who seems to have made contributions to the script in 2016.</p>
