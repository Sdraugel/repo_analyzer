                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This Python code is part of a larger software developed or modified by Raytheon Company under a US Government contract. The software contains export-restricted data, meaning its distribution is controlled by US law.

The code itself is an adapter for a class called `ActiveTableMode` from the module `com.raytheon.uf.common.activetable`. An adapter in programming is a design pattern that allows the interface of an existing class to be used as another interface. 

In this case, the adapter provides two functions: `serialize` and `deserialize`. 

- The `serialize` function takes a `context` and a `mode` as parameters. It begins writing a field with the name `__enumValue__` and a type of `TType.STRING`. It then writes the value of the `mode` parameter. Serialization is the process of converting an object's state to a byte stream, primarily for transport or storage.

- The `deserialize` function also takes a `context` as a parameter. It creates a new instance of `ActiveTableMode`, reads and discards the beginning of a field from the context's protocol, and then reads the actual enum value from the context's protocol. Deserialization is the reverse process of serialization; it converts a byte stream back into an object.

The `ClassAdapter` variable is a string that holds the full path of the `ActiveTableMode` class, which is used elsewhere in the software to refer to this class.

The code also contains a software history comment section that tracks changes to the code over time. The only entry here is for the initial creation of the code by an engineer named `wldougher` on `09/29/10`.</p>
