                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>The provided code defines a Python class named `DumpActiveTableResponse`. This class seems to be a model for a response object that contains data related to a certain operation, possibly related to dumping an active table from a database or similar data source.

The class has four attributes:

1. `dump`: This attribute is initialized as `None` and seems to hold the data that is dumped from the active table.
2. `unfilteredCount`: This attribute is initialized as `0` and could represent the count of all records in the active table before any filters are applied.
3. `filteredCount`: This attribute is also initialized as `0` and could represent the count of records after applying some filters.
4. `message`: This attribute is initialized as `None` and could be used to store any message related to the operation.

The class also has eight methods, which are standard getter and setter methods for each of the four attributes. Getter methods return the current value of the attribute, while setter methods set a new value to the attribute.

The initial part of the code is a comment block that provides information about the software, including the developer (Raytheon Company), contract details, and export control details. It also mentions a "Master Rights File.pdf" for further licensing information.</p>
