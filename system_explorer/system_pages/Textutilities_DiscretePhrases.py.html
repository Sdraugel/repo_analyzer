                <h2>DiscretePhrases.py</h2>
                <div class="description">
                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>The provided code is a Python script that is part of a larger software system developed by Raytheon Company. The script is named `DiscretePhrases.py` and its primary function is to generate text forecasts from statistical analysis of samples.

The script begins with a detailed header that includes information about the software's development, export control, contractor details, software history, and licensing information. The software is declared to be in the public domain, provided "as is", without any warranty or technical support.

The script then imports several Python modules and defines a class `DiscretePhrases` that inherits from `PhraseBuilder.PhraseBuilder`. 

The `DiscretePhrases` class contains several methods:

- `__init__`: This is the constructor method that initializes the `DiscretePhrases` object.
- `headlinesTiming`: This method is used to determine the timing phrases to be used in the forecast. It can return different types of phrases such as "EXPLICIT", "FUZZY4", "DAY_NIGHT_ONLY", or "NONE". The method currently returns `None, None`, meaning no timing words will be used.
- `Headlines`: This method returns a dictionary that describes how to generate the headlines. It includes information about the type of component, line length, methods to use, analysis list, phrase list, and auto sentence.
- `headlines_phrase`: This method returns a dictionary that describes how to generate the phrase for the headlines.
- `headlines_setUp`: This method sets up the sub-phrase for the headlines.
- `headlines_words`: This method is used to create the phrase for local headlines from the Hazards grids. The actual implementation of this method is not included in the provided code.

The script ends with a comment indicating that the `headlines_words` method is used to create the phrase for local headlines from the Hazards grids, but the actual implementation of this method is not provided in the code snippet.

This code appears to be part of a larger system that processes and formats weather-related hazard data. The code is written in Python and uses object-oriented programming.

The first part of the code retrieves a list of headlines related to hazards for a specific area and time range. If no headlines are found, it returns an empty string. If headlines are found, they are sorted by their start time. The code then filters out any headlines that are not allowed for the product being processed.

Next, the code constructs a phrase for each headline using a combination of the headline's words, a time descriptor, and additional words generated by a hook method. These phrases are then converted to uppercase and returned.

The `headlinesTimeRange_descriptor` method generates a time range descriptor for a headline. It retrieves the timing for the headline and constructs a dictionary record for the hazard. It then gets a timing phrase based on the start and end phrase types and returns it.

The code then warns not to override any code below a certain point. This is followed by several method definitions related to hazard processing. These methods seem to be used for setting up and processing a hazards table, creating phrases for watches, warnings, or advisories, and handling other hazard-related tasks.

The code snippet ends abruptly, so it's not clear what the final part of the code is doing. However, it seems to be checking for a specific entry in a dictionary called `argDict`.

This code is part of a larger system that manages and manipulates hazard data. Here's a breakdown of what the different sections do:

1. The first part of the code checks if the key "segmentAreas" exists in the dictionary `argDict`. If it does, the value of `editAreas` is updated with the value of `argDict['segmentAreas']`. It then gets a hazard string, converts it to uppercase, and sets it as the value of a node.

2. The `getAllowedHazardList` method returns a list of hazards. If the hazard is a tuple, it appends the first element of the tuple to the hazard list. If it's not a tuple, it appends the hazard directly.

3. The `getAllowedActionCodes` method returns a list of action codes for a given hazard. If the hazard is not found or actions are not specified, it returns a default list of action codes.

4. The `actionControlWord` method returns a string that describes the action to be taken for a given hazard, based on the action code.

5. The `getHazardCategory` method returns the category of a given hazard.

6. The `getHazardImportance` method returns the priority of a hazard. The lower the count, the higher the priority.

7. The `fixHazardConflict` method resolves conflicts between hazards. It determines which hazard has the highest priority and removes the lower priority hazard. If the hazards are of different categories or if one of them is not categorized, no changes are made. It also handles special cases where the hazard is of type 'SV' or 'TO'.

The provided code appears to be part of a larger Python program that deals with hazard management, specifically filtering and handling conflicts among hazards.

Here's a breakdown of what each part does:

1. `elif highEnd >= lowStart:` and `elif highStart <= lowEnd:`: These lines are part of a larger function not included in the provided code. They seem to be adjusting the start and end times of a hazard in a hazard table based on certain conditions.

2. `filterAllowedHazards(self, hazardTable)`: This method filters out hazards from the hazard table that are not in the allowed hazard list. It creates a new hazard table that only includes the allowed hazards.

3. `filterZoneHazards(self, zone, hazardTable)`: This method filters hazards based on a specific zone. It searches the hazard table for entries matching the specified zone and checks for any conflicting entries in time. If a conflict is found, it calls a function `fixHazardConflict` to resolve the conflict.

4. `filterMethod(self, hazardTable, allowedHazardsOnly=False)`: This is the main method that drives the code to filter hazards that conflict in time. It processes the hazard table, removing any time conflicts, so only one hazard of the same phenomenon is allowed per zone per time.

5. `getTimingPhrase(self, hazRec, issueTime, stype=None, etype=None)`: This function returns a timing phrase for a given hazard record and issue time. It allows for different types of timing phrases (e.g., explicit, fuzzy4, fuzzy8, day-night only) and generates the phrase accordingly. It also handles different time zones.

The last line of the provided code is incomplete, so it's not possible to provide a description for it.

This code is part of a larger program that calculates and formats timing phrases based on certain parameters. It appears to be handling different types of timing scenarios, such as "FUZZY8", "DAY_NIGHT_ONLY", and various combinations of these and other types.

The first part of the code checks the type of timing scenario and for each timezone, it generates a timing word table and appends the information to a list if it's not already present.

The second part of the code determines the timing connection types using the `getTimingConnectorType` method.

The third part of the code calculates the timing phrase based on the timing type, the calculated timing words, and the prefixes. It checks the combination of start and end types and calls the appropriate method to calculate the timing phrase. These methods format the timing phrases based on the specific requirements of each scenario.

For example, the `ctp_NONE_EXPLICIT` method formats the timing phrase for a scenario where there is no start time but an explicit end time. If there is only one timezone, it formats the phrase with the end prefix, hour, timezone, and description. If there are multiple timezones, it formats the phrase with all the hours and timezones, separated by slashes. It also handles special cases where the hour is "12 PM", changing it to "noon".

The `ctp_NONE_FUZZY` method formats the timing phrase for a scenario where there is no start time and a fuzzy end time. It returns a phrase like "THROUGH THIS EVENING".

The `ctp_EXPLICIT_EXPLICIT` method formats the timing phrase for a scenario where both the start and end times are explicit. It handles various cases, such as single or multiple timezones, same or different days, and special cases like "12 PM" and "early this morning".

The provided code appears to be a part of a larger Python program. It seems to be designed to handle and format time-related data, specifically dealing with different time zones and special cases like noon. 

The first part of the code concatenates several variables into a string. It then checks if the start and end descriptions are the same. If they are, it formats a string with multiple time zones for the same day. If they're not, it formats a string with multiple time zones for different days. In both cases, it replaces "12 PM" with "noon".

The rest of the code defines several methods, each designed to handle a different case of time formatting:

1. `ctp_EXPLICIT_FUZZY`: This method formats a string for explicit start times and fuzzy end times. It replaces "12 PM" with "noon" in the start times.

2. `ctp_FUZZY_FUZZY`: This method formats a string for fuzzy start and end times. If the start and end descriptions are the same, it returns the description. Otherwise, it formats a string with the start and end descriptions.

3. `ctp_NONE_DAYNIGHT`: This method formats a string for no start time and a day/night end time.

4. `ctp_EXPLICIT_DAYNIGHT`: This method formats a string for explicit start times and day/night end times. It replaces "12 PM" with "noon" in the start times.

5. `ctp_FUZZY_DAYNIGHT`: This method formats a string for fuzzy start times and day/night end times. If the start and end descriptions are the same, it returns the description. Otherwise, it formats a string with the start and end descriptions.

6. `ctp_DAYNIGHT_DAYNIGHT`: This method formats a string for day/night start and end times. If the start and end descriptions are the same, it returns the description. Otherwise, it formats a string with the start and end descriptions.

7. `ctp_DAYNIGHT_EXPLICIT`: This method seems to format a string for day/night start times and explicit end times, but the code is cut off.

Each method seems to return a string that describes a time period, with different formats depending on the exact times and whether they're explicit or "fuzzy" (not exact).

This code appears to be part of a larger system that handles timing and scheduling. It seems to be designed to handle a variety of different timing cases and return formatted strings based on the input. 

The first function `ctp_DAYNIGHT_NONE` returns phrases like "FROM TONIGHT". It takes in starting text and prefixes it with a start prefix and the starting description.

The second function `ctp_DAYNIGHT_FUZZY` returns phrases like "FROM TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT". It takes in starting and ending text and prefixes them with start and end prefixes respectively. If the starting and ending descriptions are the same, it returns the description; otherwise, it returns a string combining the start and end descriptions.

The `getTimingConnectorType` function returns the start and end prefix for the given start and end phrase type and action code. It uses a dictionary to map different combinations of timing types and actions to their corresponding prefixes.

The `getTimingType` function returns the timing type based on the issuance time and a hazard record. It determines the timing type based on various conditions such as whether the record is in the past, whether it's an upgrade or cancel, whether it's an expiration, and more. It also handles special cases for different types of events, such as SPC Watches, Tropical events, and marine cases.

Overall, this code seems to be part of a system that generates human-readable timing phrases based on various types of scheduling data.

This code is part of a larger program that appears to handle some sort of scheduling or timing system, possibly related to hazard warnings or advisories. It seems to be determining the start and end times for different types of hazards, which can be either explicit or fuzzy.

The code first checks if the hazard record is from an office not in the 'oconusSites' list. If it is, it checks the type of hazard ('sig') and whether it's in a list of marine hazards. Depending on the hazard type and start and end times, it assigns a 'start' and 'end' value. 

If the hazard record is from an office in the 'oconusSites' list, it follows a similar process but with some differences in the conditions checked and the values assigned to 'start' and 'end'.

The 'getLocalHeadlinesTiming' function seems to be a wrapper for the 'headlinesTiming' function, returning the start and end times for local headlines. If the start or end time is 'FUZZY', it changes it to 'FUZZY4'.

The 'hazardTimeZones' function appears to be intended to return a list of time zones for the start and end times of a hazard. It sorts the list of areas, gets the current time zone, and then retrieves a dictionary that contains time zones per edit area.

Please note that without the full context and the rest of the code, this is a best guess based on the provided code snippet.

The provided code appears to be part of a larger Python module, which is likely used for processing and analyzing time-related data, possibly in the context of weather or environmental conditions. 

The first part of the code is a function that checks a list of areas (areaList) against a dictionary of areas (areaDict). It checks if the area has a specified timezone (ugcTimeZone). If it does, it adds the timezone to a list (zoneList). If the area doesn't have a specified timezone, it adds a default timezone (thisTimeZone) to the list. If the default timezone is in the list, it ensures that it is the first item. The function returns the list of timezones.

The next two functions, timingWordTableEXPLICIT and timingWordTableFUZZY4, appear to be methods for generating descriptive phrases for specific times of the day, given a specific issue time and event time. They use tables (sameDay, nextDay, subsequentDay) to map ranges of times to descriptive phrases like "early this morning", "this afternoon", etc. 

The timingWordTableEXPLICIT function generates a description based on the exact time of the event, while the timingWordTableFUZZY4 function generates a more general description. Both functions take into account the timezone of the event and the number of days between the issue time and the event time. 

The functions also handle special cases for noon and midnight, and they adjust the timezone environment variable for the duration of the function to ensure accurate time calculations. 

The code seems to be cut off at the end, so there might be more functionality not visible in this snippet.

This code is a function named `timingWordTableFUZZY8` that takes four parameters: `issueTime`, `eventTime`, `timeZone`, and `timeType`. The function is used to return a descriptive phrase for an event, based on the event's start or end time.

The function first defines several lists (`sameDay`, `nextDayStart`, `nextDayEnd`, `subsequentDayStart`, `subsequentDayEnd`) that represent different time periods of a day and their corresponding descriptive phrases.

It then saves the current time zone, sets a new time zone, and calculates the local time of the issue and event.

Next, it calculates the difference in days between the issue and event. If the difference is negative, it assumes a year wrap around (from December to January) and adjusts the difference accordingly.

The function then determines the appropriate descriptive phrase for the event time. If the event occurs on the same day as the issue, it uses the `sameDay` list. If the event occurs on a different day, it chooses the appropriate list based on the `timeType` and the number of days difference.

The function then loops through the chosen list and checks if the event time falls within the start and end times of each period. If it does, it sets the corresponding descriptive phrase.

If the event occurs on a different day, the function also replaces placeholders in the descriptive phrase with the appropriate day of the week.

Finally, the function resets the time zone to the original one and returns a tuple containing `None`, `None`, and the descriptive phrase. The `None` values suggest that the function may have been intended to also return the hour and time zone, but these parts are not implemented in the provided code.

The code is a part of a larger system that seems to be dealing with time-based events, possibly related to weather or environmental hazards. 

The `timingWordTableDAYNIGHT` function is the main function in this code snippet. It takes in parameters such as issue time, event time, time zone, and time type. It then calculates the local time of the issue and event, and the difference in days between them. Based on this difference, it selects a description for the event time from one of three tables: `sameDay`, `nextDay`, or `subsequentDay`. These tables contain time ranges and corresponding descriptions. The function also handles the case where the event day is the previous day (week wraparound). 

The `asciiDayOfWeek` function converts a number (0-6) to the corresponding day of the week (Monday-Sunday). 

The `makeStandardPhrase` function seems to be creating a headline or description for a hazard event. It checks if the hazard is still in effect, assembles the hazard type, and gets the timing words for the hazard. 

The `timeCompare` function compares the start times of two hazards and returns -1, 0, or 1 depending on whether the first hazard's start time is less than, equal to, or greater than the second hazard's start time. 

The `marineSortHazardAlg` function appears to be a sorting algorithm for marine products, but the implementation is not provided in the given code. 

The code also modifies the environment variable "TZ" to handle time zones, but it always resets it back to its original value before the function ends.

This code seems to be part of a larger system that handles and organizes hazard data. Here's what each part does:

1. The `cmpfunc` function: This function compares two records, `r1` and `r2`, based on several criteria in a specific order: start time, action code, significance, and phen (which seems to be a type of identifier). If `r1` is less than `r2` according to the criteria, it returns -1; if `r1` is greater, it returns 1. If they're equal, it returns 0. This function is used for sorting records.

2. The `regularSortHazardAlg` function: This function is similar to `cmpfunc`, but it first sorts by whether the action is in the `actActions` or `inactActions` list. This function is also used for sorting records.

3. The `makeHeadlinePhrases` function: This function creates a string of phrases based on a list of hazards. It first sorts the hazards using the appropriate sorting function. Then, for each hazard, it checks if it can make a phrase with it (it needs a 'hdln' entry). If it can, it creates a phrase and adds it to the return string. If it can't, or if the hazard's action is not allowed, it skips the hazard.

4. The `getHazardString` function: This function gets a formatted string of hazards for a specific forecast area. It gets the list of hazards for the area, makes headline phrases with them, and returns the string in uppercase.

5. The `organizeHazard` method: The comment suggests that this method organizes a raw analyzed table by edit area, returning a list of editArea lists. The first element of the list must be the first segment in a hazard-based product. It also ensures that a group of edit areas does not contain both zones and FIPS code.

Overall, this code seems to be part of a system that organizes, sorts, and formats hazard data for different areas.

This Python code defines a function named `organizeHazards` which takes a list of hazard dictionaries as input and organizes them based on their attributes. The function is part of a larger system that deals with hazard warnings.

The function first initializes three empty data structures: two dictionaries (`byIdDict` and `byHazardDict`) and a list (`masterEditAreaList`). It then iterates over the input list of hazards (`rawATable`) and organizes them by their 'id' field into the `byIdDict` dictionary. If a hazard with a particular 'id' is encountered for the first time, it is added to the dictionary. If a hazard with the same 'id' is encountered again, it is appended to the existing list of hazards for that 'id'.

Next, the function creates a sorted list of hazards (`sortedHazards`) by iterating over the values in `byIdDict` and adding each hazard to `sortedHazards` only if it's not already present.

The function then determines the ordering of the hazards based on their 'sig' (significance) and 'act' (action) fields. A list (`segmentVTECOrderList`) is defined that specifies the order of importance of different combinations of 'sig' and 'act'. 

The function then calculates a weight for each hazard based on its position in `segmentVTECOrderList`, its 'sig' and 'act' fields, its 'seg' (segment) field, and its 'startTime' field. The weight is used to determine the order of importance of the hazards. The hazards with the highest weight are considered the most important.

The function seems to be incomplete as the last line of code is not finished and the function does not return any value. It also does not use the `byHazardDict` and `masterEditAreaList` data structures that it initializes at the beginning.

This Python code seems to be part of a larger program, possibly related to hazard management or a similar field. Here's what the different parts of the code do:

1. The first part of the code is sorting a list of hazards, each represented by a tuple of weight and area ID. The hazards are sorted by their weight. Then, the code separates the sorted list into two lists: one for zones and one for FIPS (Federal Information Processing Standards) codes.

2. The `__sortedContains` method checks if a given hazard is in a sorted list of hazards. It does this by sorting the hazard and each hazard in the list, and then comparing them. If a match is found, it returns 1, otherwise, it returns 0.

3. The `_wtListSort` method is a property that returns a function for comparing two tuples by their weight. This function is used for sorting the list of hazards.

4. The `checkTestMode` method modifies a string to indicate if the program is in test mode or experimental mode. If the 'testMode' key in the `argDict` dictionary is set, it adds "TEST..." at the beginning and end of the string. If the 'experimentalMode' key is set, it adds "EXPERIMENTAL..." instead. If neither key is set, it returns the original string.

5. The `headlinePhraseTESTcheck` method modifies a headline string to indicate if the program is in test mode. If the 'testMode' key in the `argDict` dictionary is set, it adds "TEST" at the beginning and end of each line in the string.

6. The `hazardName` method modifies a hazard name based on the program's mode and other parameters. If the 'testMode' key in the `argDict` dictionary is set, it prepends "Test " to the name. If the `addA` parameter is True, it prepends "an " or "a " to the name, depending on whether the first letter of the name is a vowel or a consonant.</p>
