                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This Python code defines a class named `GetOfficialDbNameRequest`. The class has two properties: `workstationID` and `siteID`, both of which are initialized as `None` in the constructor method `__init__`.

The class also includes getter and setter methods for each of these properties. The getter methods `getWorkstationID` and `getSiteID` return the current values of `workstationID` and `siteID` respectively. The setter methods `setWorkstationID` and `setSiteID` allow you to set the values of `workstationID` and `siteID` respectively.

The comment at the top of the code indicates that this file was auto-generated against an equivalent DynamicSerialize Java class. This suggests that this Python class is likely part of a system where Python and Java components need to interact, and this class provides a Python representation of a Java class.

The large comment block at the top of the file is a legal disclaimer from Raytheon Company, the creators of the software. It includes information about the company's contract with the US Government, export control restrictions on the software, and contact information for the contractor. It also refers to a "Master Rights File.pdf" for further licensing information.</p>
