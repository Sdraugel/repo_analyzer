                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>The provided code is a Python script that is part of a software developed by Raytheon Company. The software appears to be a part of a larger system, possibly related to weather forecasting or atmospheric modeling, given the use of terms like "Forecaster", "calcCigHgt", "calcVis", etc.

The script defines a class named `GLAMPForecaster` that inherits from a `Forecaster` class. This class has a set of methods for calculating various parameters, likely related to weather conditions. These methods include:

1. `calcCigHgt`: This method calculates the ceiling height, converting it from meters to feet and assigning a default value of -99 for negative values.

2. `calcVis`: This method calculates visibility, converting it from meters to miles.

3. `calcT` and `calcTd`: These methods convert temperature and dew point temperature from Kelvin to Fahrenheit.

4. `calcSky`: This method clips the total cloud cover at surface level between 0 and 100.

5. `calcWind`: This method calculates wind speed and direction. The wind speed is converted from meters per second to knots.

6. `calcPoP`, `calcPoP6`, and `calcPoP12`: These methods return the probability of precipitation for 1 hour, 6 hours, and 12 hours respectively.

The script also contains a `main` function that creates an instance of the `GLAMPForecaster` class and runs it. This suggests that the script could be run as a standalone program, with the `GLAMPForecaster` class performing some sort of forecasting operation.

The script also includes a substantial amount of metadata and comments, including licensing information, software history, and usage guidelines.</p>
