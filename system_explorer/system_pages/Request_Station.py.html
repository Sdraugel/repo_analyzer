                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This Python code defines a class named `Station`. The class is designed to represent a weather station with various attributes such as elevation, state, station ID, longitude, latitude, WMO (World Meteorological Organization) index, and country.

The class `Station` has an initializer method `__init__` that sets all these attributes to `None` when a new instance of the class is created.

The class also includes getter and setter methods for each attribute. Getter methods return the current value of the attribute, and setter methods update the attribute with a new value. For example, `getElevation` returns the current elevation of the station, and `setElevation` sets a new elevation for the station.

The `setLongitude` and `setLatitude` methods use the `numpy.float64` function to ensure that the longitude and latitude are stored as 64-bit floating-point numbers. This is likely done to maintain precision in the geographic coordinates.

The code also includes a comment at the top indicating that this file was auto-generated against an equivalent DynamicSerialize Java class, which suggests that this Python class is a part of a system that also includes Java code. The comment also includes a software history log, which is a common practice in software development to track changes and updates to the code.</p>
