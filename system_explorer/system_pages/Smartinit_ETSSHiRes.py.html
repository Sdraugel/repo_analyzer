                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This Python code file appears to be part of a larger software system developed by Raytheon Company, as indicated by the initial comments. The comments also mention that the software contains export-restricted data, and its export/transfer/disclosure is restricted by U.S. law.

The code itself defines a class `ETSSHiResForecaster` that inherits from a base class `Forecaster`. This class seems to be part of a system for forecasting, possibly related to weather or environmental conditions given the mention of 'storm surge guidance' and 'tide'. 

The `ETSSHiResForecaster` class has an initializer method (`__init__`) that calls the initializer of the base class `Forecaster` with specific arguments. 

It also has three methods: `calcStormSurge`, `calcSurgeTide`, and `calcAstroTide`. Each of these methods takes a single argument and returns the argument divided by 0.3048. This division is likely a unit conversion, possibly from feet to meters, as 1 foot is approximately 0.3048 meters.

The `main` function creates an instance of `ETSSHiResForecaster` and calls its `run` method. The last two lines of the code ensure that the `main` function is called if the file is run as a standalone script. 

The comments indicate that this is a base file and not intended to be overridden. However, it can be subclassed to override behavior. The 'smart init' mentioned in the comments suggests that this file is part of a system that uses smart initialization, a technique where an object's initial state is set in a way that reduces the need for further configuration or setup.</p>
