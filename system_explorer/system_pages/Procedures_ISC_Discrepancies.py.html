                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This Python script is a part of a software developed or modified by Raytheon Company. The script is intended to run a tool called Show_ISC_Highlights on a set of weather elements. 

The script starts by importing necessary modules such as ISC_Utility_Local, SmartScript, time, and ProcessVariableList. It then defines a class named Procedure, which inherits from the SmartScript class. 

In the Procedure class, two methods are defined: __init__ and execute. The __init__ method is the constructor that initializes the Procedure object with a database session (dbss). The execute method is where the main functionality of the script resides. 

In the execute method, the script sets up a utility object, creates a variable list, determines elements and time ranges, and then runs the Show_ISC_Highlights tool for each element over the specified time range. 

If the element is "Wx", the script prints a message saying it's not yet able to identify discrepancies for "Wx" and skips to the next element. If the element is not "Wx", the script prints a message saying it's running discrepancies for the element, then calls the Show_ISC_Highlights tool. 

The script also measures and prints the time it takes to run the tool for each element and the total time it takes to run the tool for all elements. 

The script is in the public domain and is furnished "as is", without technical support, and with no warranty. It is not intended to be overridden.</p>
