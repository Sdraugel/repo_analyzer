                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This code is written in Python and it defines a class named `LockTableRequest`. This class has two attributes: `parmId` and `dbId`, both of which are initialized as `None` in the constructor method (`__init__`). 

The class also includes getter and setter methods for these two attributes. The getter methods (`getParmId` and `getDbId`) return the current values of `parmId` and `dbId` respectively. The setter methods (`setParmId` and `setDbId`) set the values of `parmId` and `dbId` respectively.

The comments at the top of the file indicate that this software was developed and/or modified by Raytheon Company under a specific contract with the US Government. The software contains export-restricted data, and its dissemination to non-U.S. persons requires an export license or other authorization. 

The file appears to be auto-generated against an equivalent DynamicSerialize Java class, suggesting that this Python class is likely part of a system where Python and Java are used together, possibly for data serialization and deserialization. 

The address and contact details of the contractor (Raytheon Company) are also provided. There's a reference to a document called "AWIPS II Master Rights File.pdf" for further licensing information. AWIPS II (Advanced Weather Interactive Processing System) is a meteorological display and data analysis tool developed by the National Weather Service and Raytheon, which suggests that this code may be related to weather data processing.</p>
