                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This Python script is part of a software developed by Raytheon Company. It's a GUI application that fetches and displays an inventory of Weather Convective Level (WCL) products. The WCL products are fetched from a directory specified by the GFE (Graphical Forecast Editor) localization.

Here's a high-level overview of the code:

1. It imports necessary modules like `os`, `SmartScript`, `re`, `time`, `AbsTime`, `TimeRange`, `tkinter`, `HazardUtils`, and `numpy`.

2. It defines a class `Procedure` that inherits from `SmartScript.SmartScript`. This class is used to create a GUI for viewing WCL products.

3. The `Procedure` class has several methods:

   - `__init__`: Initializes the class with a database session object (`dbss`).

   - `setUpUI`: Sets up the user interface. It fetches the WCL inventory and creates a tkinter window with frames and buttons for each WCL product.

   - `getWclDir`: Gets the directory where the WCL products are stored, using GFE localization.

   - `getWCLInventoryDict`: Fetches the text inventory for WCL products and stores it in a dictionary.

   - `makeInventoryButtons`: Creates a button for each entry in the inventory.

The script also mentions that it's in the public domain, provided "as is", without technical support or warranty. It also contains information about the software's export restrictions under U.S. law.

This Python code appears to be part of a larger program that uses the Tkinter library to create a graphical user interface (GUI). Here's what the different parts of the code do:

1. The code first creates a button with a text label and a value. If the name of the button matches the first name, the button is selected by default.

2. The `WCLSelected` function is a placeholder that currently does nothing when a selection is made.

3. The `_deleteWCLGrids` function deletes grid information for a given time range.

4. The `makeRunButton`, `makeRunDismissButton`, and `makeCancelButton` functions create buttons labeled "Run", "Run/Dismiss", and "Cancel" respectively, with associated commands to execute when each button is clicked.

5. The `runCommand`, `runDismissCommand`, and `cancelCommand` functions are the commands associated with the "Run", "Run/Dismiss", and "Cancel" buttons respectively. The `runCommand` and `runDismissCommand` functions plot a product, while the `cancelCommand` function destroys the main window.

6. The `execute` function sets up the user interface and starts the main event loop of the Tkinter application.

7. The `plotWCL` function plots the watch areas by fetching a specified text product, decoding it, and creating a temporary grid that shows the areas of the proposed watches.

The code appears to be part of a weather-related application, as it references weather-related terms like "watch areas", "Hazards Weather Element", and "active table".

This code is part of a larger script, presumably for a weather-related application, that generates a grid representing proposed watch areas based on certain conditions.

Here's a breakdown of what the code does:

1. It starts by appending a tuple of `each` and `actualKey` to the `finalKeys` list. The `each` and `actualKey` variables are not defined in the provided code, but they are likely defined elsewhere in the script.

2. It then calculates a time range. If the absolute difference between the current time and `startTime` or `endTime` is greater than 43200 seconds (12 hours), it adjusts these times to the nearest hour. It then creates a `TimeRange` object using these start and end times.

3. It creates an empty grid of zeros using the `self.empty` method.

4. It defines a list of allowed keys, which are presumably types of watches.

5. It loops over the `finalKeys` list. For each key, it gets its index in the `keys` list. If the key is in the edit area list, it retrieves the corresponding edit area, encodes it, and sets the corresponding grid cell to `True`. It then sets the grid cell to the watch index.

6. It checks the loaded parameters for a parameter named "ProposedWatches" at the "SFC" level in the "WCL" model. If it finds such a parameter, it deletes any existing grids.

7. It creates a new grid with the name "ProposedWatches" in the "WCL" model, using the previously generated grid and keys. It sets this grid as the active element and assigns it a color table.

8. Finally, it returns, ending the function.

This code is likely part of a larger system for generating and displaying weather watch areas. The grid it generates represents different watch areas, with each cell corresponding to a different area and its value representing the type of watch in effect for that area.</p>
