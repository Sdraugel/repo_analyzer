                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This Python script is designed to update the headers of files in a specified directory. The script is developed by Raytheon Company under a contract with the US Government and contains export-restricted data.

The script starts by importing necessary libraries and modules. It then defines a version number for this script.

The main function of the script is defined as `main()`. This function starts by setting up an OptionParser object, which is used to parse command line options. It adds several options to the parser, such as `--filters` to filter the files in the directory according to a given filter file, `--file-log` to keep a log of (filtered) files found and fed to the header updater, and a group option to specify a directory containing files to update.

The script then checks if the user has provided a directory as an argument. If not, it throws an error.

If a directory is provided, the script creates a FileFilter object with the filter file provided by the user (if any). It then uses the `subprocess` module to run a shell command (`find`) that finds all files in the specified directory. The output of this command (a list of file paths) is then filtered using the FileFilter object.

If the user has specified a log file to keep track of the found files, the script writes the list of filtered file paths to this log file.

Finally, the script loops over each file in the filtered list, and calls the `main()` function of the `HeaderUpdater` module on each file. This function presumably updates the header of the file.

The script is designed to be run as a standalone program, as indicated by the `if __name__ == "__main__":` line at the end. If the script is run directly (rather than being imported as a module), it calls the `main()` function.</p>
