                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This code file appears to be a part of a software tool developed by Raytheon Company for the US Government, as per Contract DG133W-05-CQ-1067. The software is subject to U.S. export control laws and cannot be disseminated to non-U.S. persons without proper authorization.

The software is a public domain tool named "Swell2Tool". It is provided as is, without any warranty or technical support. The tool appears to be used for some kind of numerical analysis related to weather data, as indicated by the variable "WeatherElementEdited" being set to "Swell2".

The tool uses the numpy library, which is a powerful library for numerical computations in Python. It also imports a module named "SmartScript", which seems to be a custom module, possibly for handling some specific tasks related to this tool.

The main functionality of the tool is encapsulated in a class named "Tool", which inherits from "SmartScript.SmartScript". The class has an "execute" method that takes a "Wind" parameter and calculates "Swell2Mag" and "Swell2Dir" based on the input. The method then returns these two values.

There are also some commented out sections of the code that suggest the tool might have additional functionality for handling user input, pre-processing and post-processing tasks, and error handling. However, these sections are currently inactive.

The code also includes some explanatory comments about the use of "self" in Python and how to handle errors in the tool.</p>
