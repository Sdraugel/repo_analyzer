                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This code is a Python script that defines an abstract base class named `GfeNotification`. The script begins with a comment block that includes licensing information and a brief history of the software's development. 

The `GfeNotification` class is defined with two instance variables: `siteID` and `sourceID`, both of which are initialized as `None` in the class's constructor method (`__init__`). This class is an abstract base class, as indicated by the `metaclass=abc.ABCMeta` argument in the class definition and the `@abc.abstractmethod` decorator before the `__init__` method. This means that this class is intended to be a base class for other classes and cannot be instantiated on its own.

The class also includes getter and setter methods for both `siteID` and `sourceID`. The getter methods (`getSiteID` and `getSourceID`) return the current value of the respective instance variable. The setter methods (`setSiteID` and `setSourceID`) accept a parameter and assign its value to the respective instance variable.

Overall, this script is defining a blueprint for a type of notification within a larger system, where each notification has a site ID and a source ID. Other classes in the system can inherit from `GfeNotification` and utilize its structure while adding their own additional functionality.</p>
