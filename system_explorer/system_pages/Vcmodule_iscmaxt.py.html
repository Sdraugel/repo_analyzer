                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This Python script appears to be part of a larger software system developed by Raytheon Company. It's a module for handling and manipulating time ranges and temperature data, likely for some sort of weather or climate analysis.

The script defines a class `VCParm` with several methods for manipulating and comparing time ranges (`tr`), which are represented as tuples of two values. These methods include:

- `splitTR`: Splits a time range into smaller ranges if it overlaps with any range in a given list.
- `tcmp`: Compares two time ranges based on their starting times.
- `getInventory`: Returns a list of time ranges from a given list that overlap with any time range in another list.
- `poverlap`: Returns the percentage of overlap between two time ranges.
- `calcGrid`: Returns the maximum temperature grid from a given list of temperature grids.
- `calcHistory`: Returns a list of all temperature grids from a given list of temperature grid tuples.
- `getWEInfo`: Returns a tuple of information about the weather element.
- `_containsTR`, `_contains`, `_overlaps`, `_intersect`: These are helper methods used for comparing and manipulating time ranges.

The script also imports the `time` module and the `numpy` library, and defines several constants at the top of the file. The constants include different types of weather data and boolean values represented as `YES` and `NO`.

The comments at the top of the file provide some legal and contractual information about the software, as well as a brief history of changes made to the software.</p>
