                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This code file appears to be a part of a software developed by Raytheon Company. It's a script written in Python and seems to be part of a weather analysis or prediction tool, specifically a module for calculating hours of sunlight.

Here's a breakdown of what the code does:

1. It starts with a comment block that includes legal information about the software, including export restrictions and licensing details.

2. The script defines a tool type as "numeric" and the weather element to be edited as "HrsOfSun". It also imports all functions from the numpy library.

3. There's a commented-out section that seems to be for setting up variables to be solicited from the user. This could be used to customize the tool's behavior based on user input.

4. The script then imports the SmartScript module and defines a class named "Tool" that inherits from SmartScript.SmartScript. This class has an `__init__` method for initialization and an `execute` method that appears to calculate the hours of sunlight based on some input `T`. The result is a numpy array (since all numpy functions are imported) with the same shape as `T`, but all elements are 14.0.

5. There are also some optional methods commented out (`preProcessTool` and `postProcessTool`) which could be used for preprocessing and postprocessing when the tool is run.

6. The script ends with some comments explaining how to use the `self` keyword in Python and how to handle errors in the tool.

Overall, this script seems to be a template or skeleton for creating a tool to calculate the hours of sunlight. It's designed to be customized and extended based on specific needs.</p>
