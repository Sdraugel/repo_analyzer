                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>The provided code is a configuration for a weather forecasting software developed by Raytheon Company. The software generates a table of weather forecasts for different time periods and areas. The table includes information about the sky condition (in percentage), wind speed (in mph), temperature, and precipitation (in percentage).

Here is a detailed breakdown of what the code does:

1. The software is identified as being developed by Raytheon Company under a specific contract with the US Government. It also mentions that the software contains export-restricted data.

2. It provides the contractor's name, address, and contact information.

3. It refers to a document ("Master Rights File.pdf") for further licensing information.

4. It describes the 'PeriodByElement' table, which is generated by the software. The table is editable by the user and can be run by selecting 'Generate Products' from the 'Products' menu.

5. It provides an example of the output of the software, which is a table of weather forecasts for different time periods (Today, Tonight, Tomorrow) and areas (Area 1, Area 2).

6. The 'Definition' dictionary at the end of the code is a configuration for generating the 'PeriodByElement' table. It specifies the type of the table, the display name, the output file, the variables for the rows and columns of the table, the text to be displayed at the beginning and the end of the table, the default edit areas and time ranges, the list of weather elements to be included in the table, the time period for the forecasts, and the format for the period label.</p>
