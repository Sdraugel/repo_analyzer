                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This part of the file appears to be a combination of a legal notice and some Python code.

The legal notice indicates that the software was developed and/or modified by Raytheon Company under a specific contract with the US Government. It also mentions that the software contains export-restricted data, which means it cannot be exported/transferred/disclosed without proper authorization under U.S. law. The contractor's name, address, and contact information are provided as well. There's also a reference to a document called "AWIPS II Master Rights File.pdf" for more information about licensing.

The Python code part is quite simple. It's a module-level variable called `__all__`, which is a list that defines the public interface of the module. It specifies which names should be available when a client imports this module using the `from module import *` syntax. In this case, only the name 'raytheon' is made available for import. 

The comment above the Python code indicates that this file was auto-generated by a tool called PythonFileGenerator.</p>
