                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This Python code is a part of a software developed by Raytheon Company. It appears to be a part of a weather forecasting system, possibly the Advanced Weather Interactive Processing System (AWIPS). The code contains a number of functions that process weather-related data, such as visibility, wind direction, wind magnitude, and weather conditions. 

The code also includes a class `FakeWxKey`, which seems to be a mock or stand-in for a weather key object used for testing purposes. This class has a method to split a string value into subkeys.

The functions in the code are designed to handle and process different types of weather data:

1. `scalarValue(value)`: Returns a rounded integer value of the input as a string. If the input cannot be rounded and converted, it returns "999".

2. `vsbyValue(value)`: Multiplies the input value by 100, rounds it, and returns it as a string. If the input cannot be processed, it returns "999".

3. `skyValue(value)`: Adds 5 to the input value, divides it by 10, rounds it, and returns it as a string. If the input cannot be processed, it returns "999".

4. `windDirValue(value)`: Divides the input value by 10, rounds it, and returns it as a string. If the input cannot be processed, it returns "999".

5. `windMagValue(value)`: Returns the rounded input value as a string. If the input cannot be processed, it returns "999".

6. `obvisValue(value)`: Finds the first obstruction to vision type and reports that.

7. `wxVal(value, index)`: Gets the Nth weather type, where N is given in `index`.

8. `wxValInst(value, index)`: Gets the Nth weather intensity, where N is given in `index`.

9. `wxValCov(value, index)`: Gets the Nth weather coverage, where N is given in `index`.

10. `wxTstm(value)`: Searches for any reference to thunderstorms and, if found, returns the coverage expected.

11. `wxTstmInt(value)`: Searches for any reference to thunderstorms and, if found, returns the intensity expected.

The code also includes a list of visibility codes and a dictionary to translate weather codes.

This code defines two classes that manipulate and access data in specific ways.

The first class, which is unnamed in the provided code, appears to be a container for subkeys. It defines methods for getting a subkey by its index (`__getitem__`), getting the number of subkeys (`__len__`), and iterating over the subkeys (`__iter__`). The first line of code is a method that returns a string representation of all the subkeys, with each subkey separated by a caret ("^").

The second class, `FakeWxSubkey`, represents a weather subkey with four attributes: coverage (`cov`), type (`type`), intensity (`inten`), and visibility (`vis`). These attributes are initialized by splitting a provided string at each colon. The class also provides methods to return each of these attributes individually. The `__str__` method returns a string representation of the object, with each attribute separated by a colon. 

In summary, the first class is a container for subkeys, and the second class represents a weather subkey with specific attributes.</p>
