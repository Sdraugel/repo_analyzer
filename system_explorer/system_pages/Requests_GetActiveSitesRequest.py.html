                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This code file appears to be a part of a software developed by Raytheon Company under a contract with the US Government. The software contains export-restricted data, and its dissemination to non-U.S. persons, whether in the United States or abroad, requires an export license or other authorization.

The file also provides the contractor's name, address, and contact information. It references a document called the "AWIPS II Master Rights File" for further licensing information.

The actual code in the file defines a Python class named `GetActiveSitesRequest`. This class is likely used to request active sites in the context of the software. The class has an initializer method (`__init__`) that calls the initializer of the superclass. It's noted that the file is auto-generated against an equivalent DynamicSerialize Java class, suggesting that this Python class is a part of a system that also involves Java code and that the classes are likely generated programmatically to ensure consistency across languages.

However, without more context or more code, it's not possible to determine the exact functionality of the `GetActiveSitesRequest` class.</p>
