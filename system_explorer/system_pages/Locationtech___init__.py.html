                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This part of the file is primarily a legal notice and metadata about the file.

The initial comment block is a legal notice from Raytheon Company. It states that the software was developed and/or modified by Raytheon under a specific contract with the US Government. It also contains a warning about U.S. export control laws, stating that the software contains data whose export is restricted by U.S. law. The notice includes the contractor's name, address, and contact information. It also refers to a document called the "AWIPS II Master Rights File" for further licensing information.

Following the legal notice, there is a comment stating that the file was auto-generated by a tool called PythonFileGenerator.

The actual Python code in this snippet is a single line, which defines a list called `__all__` that contains a single string, 'jts'. The `__all__` variable in Python is a list that defines the public interface of a module. It specifies which names should be imported when a client imports a module using the `from module import *` syntax. In this case, if another module were to import this one using that syntax, only the 'jts' name would be imported.</p>
