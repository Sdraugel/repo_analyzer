                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>The code is written in Python and it is a part of a larger software developed or modified by Raytheon Company. It appears to be a part of a system called AWIPS II, as indicated by the reference to a "Master Rights File.pdf" for licensing information.

The code defines a class called `ExportGridsRequest` which is a subclass of `AbstractGfeRequest`. This class seems to be a Python implementation of a similar class in Java, as part of a system called DynamicSerialize. The class was auto-generated against the equivalent Java class, but additional methods have been added.

The `ExportGridsRequest` class has two instance variables: `site` and `mode`. The `site` variable is likely to represent some sort of location or site identifier, and `mode` probably represents the mode of operation for the export grids request.

The class has getter and setter methods for both `site` and `mode`. The setter for `mode` checks that the input is one of three valid values: 'CRON', 'MANUAL', or 'GRIB2'. If the input is not one of these, it raises a ValueError.

The class also has `__str__` and `__repr__` methods, which return string representations of the object for display and debugging purposes. These methods include the values of `workstationID`, `siteID`, `site`, and `mode`.

The code also contains a software history comment section, which shows that the initial creation of this code was by an engineer named dgilling on 04/05/13.</p>
