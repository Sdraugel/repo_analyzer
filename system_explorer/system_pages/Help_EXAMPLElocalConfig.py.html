                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This Python code file appears to be a configuration file for a software developed by Raytheon Company, as indicated by the comments at the top of the file. The comments also mention that the software contains export-restricted data, and its dissemination is controlled by U.S. law.

The actual code begins with importing everything from a module named `serverConfig`. It then re-imports `serverConfig` again, which may be redundant unless there's a specific reason to do so.

The code then defines a tuple `rh` that seems to represent a parameter related to relative humidity. This parameter has a name ("RH"), a type (SCALAR), a unit ("%"), a description ("Relative Humidity"), a maximum value (100.0), a minimum value (0.0), and two other values (0, NO) whose purpose is not clear from this snippet.

Next, it creates a list `parms` that contains a tuple. This tuple contains a list with `rh` as its only element and another value `TC1`. The purpose of `parms` and `TC1` is not clear from this snippet.

The comments suggest that this code is an example `localConfig.py` file. In a broader context, this file would likely be used to configure some aspects of the software's operation, particularly those related to handling relative humidity data.</p>
