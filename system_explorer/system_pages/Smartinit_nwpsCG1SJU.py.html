                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This code file is a part of a software developed by Raytheon Company. The software contains export-restricted data, and its dissemination to non-U.S. persons, whether in the United States or abroad, requires an export license or other authorization.

The code itself is a Python script that defines a class `nwpsCG1SJUForecaster` which is a subclass of `nwpsCG1Forecaster`. This class is used for calculating surface weather elements from the `nwpsCG1` model output.

The `nwpsCG1SJUForecaster` class has an initializer method (`__init__`) that calls the initializer of the parent class with "nwpsCG1SJU" as parameters.

The `main` function creates an instance of the `nwpsCG1SJUForecaster` class, runs it, and then notifies the GFE (Graphical Forecast Editor) with 'SJU' (which could be a station identifier).

The last two lines of the code ensure that the `main` function is called if the script is run as the main program (as opposed to being imported as a module).

The comments in the code also indicate that this is a base file not intended to be overridden, but can be subclassed to override behavior. It also mentions that the file was created by Joe Maloney on 2016-07-18 for a smart init for the `nwpsCG1SJU` model.</p>
