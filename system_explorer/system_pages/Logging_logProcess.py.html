                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This Python script is a custom logging server that receives log records from multiple processes over a TCP connection and logs them according to a local logging policy. 

At the start, the script imports necessary modules and sets a log threshold. It then imports a custom log configuration from `logConfig` module. 

The `LogRecordStreamHandler` class is a handler for streaming logging requests. It receives log records in pickle format over a TCP connection, deserializes them, and logs them according to the local logging policy. If the log message is a dictionary containing timing information and the total time exceeds a certain threshold, it constructs a detailed log message with timing entries.

The `LogRecordSocketReceiver` class is a TCP server that listens for incoming log records. It can be stopped by setting its `abort` attribute to a truthy value.

The `main` function starts the TCP server and keeps it running until it is stopped. 

This script is designed to be run as a standalone program. When run as a script, it starts the TCP server and keeps it running until it is stopped. 

The comments at the top of the script indicate that it was developed by Raytheon Company for the US Government, and it contains export-restricted data. The software history shows that it has been modified multiple times, with the most recent modification being made to fix issues related to Python 3 compatibility.</p>
