                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This Python code is part of a larger software system developed by Raytheon Company. It appears to be a module or component related to a product called "SmartElementTable_Local". 

The code starts with a large comment block that includes legal and contract information, as well as instructions on how to customize the product for a specific site. 

The code then imports several Python libraries: SmartElementTable, string, time, re, os, types, and copy. 

Next, it defines a class called TextProduct that inherits from SmartElementTable.TextProduct. This class has a dictionary attribute called Definition which is a deep copy of the Definition attribute of the parent class. 

The "displayName" key of the Definition dictionary is set to "TEST_SmartElementTable". There are several commented out lines of code that suggest this dictionary can be used to customize various aspects of the product, such as the output file, default edit areas, region list, element list, and intro letters.

The class also has an initializer method (__init__) that calls the initializer of the parent class.

This code seems to be a template or skeleton for creating a customized version of the SmartElementTable product. The commented out lines provide examples of how to customize various aspects of the product.</p>
