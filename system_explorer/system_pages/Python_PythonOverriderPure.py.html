                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This Python script is part of a software developed by Raytheon Company. It appears to be a module that merges multiple Python modules retrieved from localization. Localization in this context seems to refer to the process of adapting software for different languages, regional differences and technical requirements of a target locale.

The script imports several modules and libraries, including os, tempfile, shutil, numpy, and several modules from the dynamicserialize package. 

The script defines two functions: `importModule` and `_executeLocalizationFileListRetrieval`. 

The `importModule` function takes several parameters including the name of the localization file, the server and port for localization, the site and user for localization, the type of localization files to retrieve, and the minimum level that localization files should be retrieved for. It then retrieves a list of localization files that need to be merged, downloads these files, and completes the module merge.

The `_executeLocalizationFileListRetrieval` function executes a list utility command via thrift to retrieve a list of localization files that match the specified file name, match the specified localization type, and that can be found within the specified localization levels.

The script also includes a TODO comment indicating a future update to use the HTTP Rest Service to retrieve localization files instead of thrift.

The script also includes a software history section, which provides a log of changes made to the software over time.

This Python code is part of a larger system that interacts with a server to download, manipulate, and clean up localization files. Here is a breakdown of what each function does:

1. The first part of the code sets the context for a command based on the localization level (either 'SITE' or 'USER'), adds the command to a list of commands, and sends the list of commands to the server using a thrift client. If the server request fails, it raises a RuntimeError.

2. The `_downloadLocalizationFiles` function takes a server response, a thrift client, and a file name as parameters. It loops through the server response to find the specified file, retrieves the file from the server, writes the file to a temporary directory, and adds the file path to a list. If a file fails to write, it removes any successfully created files and raises an IOError. The function returns a list of downloaded files.

3. The `_executeModuleMerge` function takes a list of Python modules, merges them using the `PythonOverriderCore._internalOverride` function, removes the temporary localization files, and returns the merged module.

4. The `_removeTemporaryLocalizationFiles` function takes a list of files and removes the directories containing these files.

5. The `_retrieveFileFromServer` function takes a localization context, a file name, and a thrift client as parameters. It sends a request to the server to retrieve the specified file and appends the file bytes to a numpy array. If the server response is not successful, it raises a RuntimeError. The function returns the file bytes.

Overall, this code is designed to handle the retrieval, manipulation, and cleanup of localization files from a server.</p>
