                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This Python code defines an interface for data stores. The interface is named `IDataStore` and it contains several methods that are not implemented. These methods are `store`, `delete`, `retrieve`, `getDatasets`, `retrieveDatasets`, `retrieveGroups`, `deleteFiles`, `createDataset`, and `deleteOrphanFiles`. Each of these methods raises a `NotImplementedException` when called, indicating that the method should be implemented in a subclass.

The code also includes three helper functions: `_exc`, `_line`, and `_file`. The `_exc` function is used to format and return exception information. The `_line` function returns the line number in the code where this function was called. The `_file` function returns the name of the file where this function was called.
