                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>The code is a Python script that seems to be part of a larger software system, possibly for geographic or meteorological data processing, developed by Raytheon Company. The script is primarily concerned with the configuration of local maps, specifically for the state of Wyoming.

The script begins with a detailed comment block that provides information about the software's development, including the contractor's name and address. It also contains a warning about U.S. export control laws, indicating that the software contains export-restricted data.

The script then imports everything (*) from a module named 'Maps'. This suggests that 'Maps' is a module that contains classes, functions, or variables that are needed in this script.

The main part of the script creates and configures an object named 'WYcounties' from a class or function called 'ShapeTable'. It appears that 'ShapeTable' is likely a class or function defined in the 'Maps' module that represents a table of geographic shapes, possibly counties in this context.

The 'WYcounties' object is then configured to represent the counties of Wyoming. This is done by applying a filter to the 'ShapeTable' object that includes only entries where the 'state' attribute is equal to "WY".

The 'WYcounties' object is then given a name, 'WYCounties', and an 'editAreaName' attribute, which is a list containing 'state' and 'countyname'. It's also assigned a 'groupName' attribute, which is also 'WYCounties'.

Finally, the 'WYcounties' object is appended to a list named 'maps'. This suggests that 'maps' is a list that contains multiple 'ShapeTable' objects, each representing a different group of geographic areas.</p>
