                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This code file appears to be part of a larger software system developed by Raytheon Company under a contract with the US Government. The software contains export-restricted data, meaning it is subject to U.S. export laws and cannot be disseminated to non-U.S. persons without proper authorization.

The code itself is written in Python and is part of a base file that is not intended to be overridden. It is in the public domain, provided without technical support or warranty.

The primary purpose of this code is to produce a Hazardous Weather Outlook (HWO) product. The code imports several modules, including a module named Hazard_HWO_<MultiPil>, TextRules, and several standard Python libraries such as string, time, re, os, types, and copy.

The code defines a class named TextProduct that inherits from Hazard_HWO_<MultiPil>.TextProduct. It deep copies the definition of the parent class and sets the 'displayName' attribute to "Hazard_HWO_<MultiPil> (Hazardous Weather Outlook)".

The '__init__' method is the constructor of the TextProduct class. It calls the constructor of the parent class when an instance of TextProduct is created. 

The author of this code is Matt Davis from ARX.</p>
