                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This Python script appears to be part of a larger software package developed by Raytheon Company for the US Government. The script is subject to export control restrictions due to the sensitive nature of the data it may handle.

The script defines a class called `ESTOFSForecaster` that inherits from a base class called `Forecaster`. The `ESTOFSForecaster` class has two methods: `calcStormSurge` and `calcAstroTide`. Both methods take a single argument and return the argument multiplied by 3.2808. This multiplication likely serves to convert the units of the input data, possibly from meters to feet, given that 1 meter equals approximately 3.2808 feet.

The `calcStormSurge` method is described as ingesting gridded ESTOFS storm surge guidance, while the `calcAstroTide` method ingests gridded ESTOFS astrological tide guidance. ESTOFS likely refers to the Extratropical Storm Surge model from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

The script also defines a `main` function that creates an instance of the `ESTOFSForecaster` class and calls its `run` method. This `main` function is executed if the script is run as a standalone program (i.e., not imported as a module in another script).</p>
