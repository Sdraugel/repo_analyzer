                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This code is a Python script that appears to be part of a larger software system developed by Raytheon Company. The software is subject to U.S. export control laws, meaning it contains sensitive information that cannot be exported or disclosed without proper authorization.

The script defines a Python module that calculates surface weather elements from a model named "nwpsCG1". The module is defined within a class named "nwpsCG1ALUForecaster", which is a subclass of "nwpsCG1Forecaster". This class has an initialization method (__init__) that takes no parameters and initializes an instance of the "nwpsCG1Forecaster" class with the model name "nwpsCG1ALU".

The script also defines a main function that creates an instance of the "nwpsCG1ALUForecaster" class, runs the forecaster, and then notifies the GFE (likely a part of the larger system this script is a part of) with a message 'ALU'.

The last two lines of the script ensure that the main function is called if the script is run as a standalone program (as opposed to being imported as a module in another script).</p>
