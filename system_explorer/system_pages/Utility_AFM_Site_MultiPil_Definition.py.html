                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This code file appears to be a configuration script for a software product developed by Raytheon Company. The software is related to the AFM (Area Forecast Matrices) formatter for a specific site. 

The script starts with a legal notice, stating that the software was developed under a specific contract with the US Government and contains export-restricted data. It also provides the contractor's name and contact details.

The script then provides a disclaimer that the software is in the public domain, furnished "as is", without technical support or warranty.

The main part of the script is a series of definitions and configuration settings for the AFM formatter. These include:

- A dictionary named `Definition` which is used to store various configuration settings.
- Several commented-out lines of code that could be used to include a Tropical Storm Winds Flag in the configuration.
- Required configuration items such as the display name, whether to show the zone combiner, default edit areas, map name for combinations, product type, and identifiers for the product.
- Optional configuration items such as the source database, debug mode, edit area suffix, and thresholds for temperature, QPF (Quantitative Precipitation Forecast), and snow amount.
- Options for including or excluding Snow Amount, Heat Index, and Wind Chill in the forecast, along with their respective thresholds.
- A reference to an area dictionary that contains zone information.

The script ends with a note that no changes should be made to the file, indicating that it is a base file not intended to be overridden.</p>
