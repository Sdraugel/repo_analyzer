                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This Python script is part of a larger software system developed by Raytheon Company under a contract with the US Government. The software contains export-restricted data and is subject to U.S. export control laws.

The script defines a module that calculates surface weather elements from the output of a model named 'nwpsTrkngCG0'. The module is defined in a class named 'nwpsTrkngCG0PQRForecaster', which is a subclass of 'nwpsTrkngCG0Forecaster'. 

The 'nwpsTrkngCG0PQRForecaster' class has an initializer method that calls the initializer of its superclass with two arguments: "nwpsTrkngCG0PQR" and "nwpsTrkngCG0PQR". 

The script also defines a main function that creates an instance of 'nwpsTrkngCG0PQRForecaster', runs the forecaster, and then notifies the GFE with a 'PQR' message.

The main function is executed if the script is run as the main program. If the script is imported as a module in another script, the main function is not executed. 

The script also contains comments indicating that it is a base file that is not intended to be overridden, but can be subclassed to override behavior. There are references to a 'Smart Initialization Configuration' section of the GFE Online Help for guidance on creating a new smart init. 

The script was last modified by Joe Maloney on 2016-07-08.</p>
