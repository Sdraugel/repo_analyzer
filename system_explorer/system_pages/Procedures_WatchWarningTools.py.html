                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This part of the code file appears to be a Python script for a software tool that is in the public domain. The script is part of a tool called "WatchWarningTools", and it has been authored by Matt Belk, Tom LeFebvre, Pablo Santos, and Shannon White. The software history indicates that it was last updated on May 20, 2020, by Tom LeFebvre, who addressed some code review comments.

The code defines a list of menu items and a list of variables. The variable list seems to be used for creating a selection interface, where the user can select a tool to run from a list of options.

The code then imports a module named "SmartScript" and defines a class "Procedure" that inherits from "SmartScript.SmartScript". This class has two methods: 

1. `__init__`: This is the constructor method that is called when an object is created from the class. It calls the constructor of the parent class with the argument `dbss`.

2. `execute`: This method takes a dictionary `varDict` as an argument. It retrieves the tool name from the dictionary using the key "Select Tool to Run:", and then calls another method `callProcedure` with the tool name as an argument. 

The purpose of this code seems to be to provide a user interface for running different tools, and to execute the selected tool.</p>
