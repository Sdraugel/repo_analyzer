                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This Python code appears to be part of a larger software system developed by Raytheon Company for the U.S. Government. The code is subject to U.S. export control laws and cannot be disseminated without proper authorization.

The code itself defines a class `TextProduct` that extends from a base `TextProduct` class in the `Hazard_FFA_<MultiPil>` module. This class seems to be related to a hazard or flood watch system, as indicated by the `displayName` attribute set to "Hazard_FFA_<MultiPil> (Flood Watch)".

The `TextProduct` class has a `Definition` dictionary that is a deep copy of the `Definition` dictionary from the base `TextProduct` class. This dictionary is used to define various properties of the `TextProduct` instance.

There are several commented out lines in the `Definition` dictionary that suggest it can be configured to include an EAS phrase in the product header, set a hazard sampling threshold, include an overview headline and section, and determine cities from grids.

The code block that should not be overridden sets the `defaultEditAreas` and `mapNameForCombinations` attributes based on the `areaType`. If `areaType` is "FIPS", these attributes are set to "EditAreas_FIPS_<site>_<MultiPil>" and "FIPS_<site>", respectively. Otherwise, they are set to "EditAreas_PublicZones_<site>_<MultiPil>" and "Zones_<site>", respectively.

The `__init__` method of the `TextProduct` class simply calls the `__init__` method of the base `TextProduct` class. This suggests that no additional initialization is performed when an instance of this `TextProduct` class is created.</p>
