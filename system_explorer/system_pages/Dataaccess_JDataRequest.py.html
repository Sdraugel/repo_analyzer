                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This Python code is part of a larger software system developed by Raytheon Company. It is a wrapper around a Java IDataRequest object, which is part of the AWIPS (Advanced Weather Interactive Processing System) data access framework. The code is used to handle data requests within the system.

The `JDataRequest` class defined in the code implements the IDataRequest interface and extends the JUtil.JavaWrapperClass. It provides methods to set and get various parameters of the data request, such as the data type, identifiers, parameters, levels, envelope, and location names. 

The class also provides methods to convert data between Python and Java formats using the `JUtil.pyValToJavaObj` and `JUtil.javaObjToPyVal` methods. This is necessary because the AWIPS system is written in Java, but this code is written in Python.

The `setEnvelope` and `getEnvelope` methods deal with geographical data. They use the JTS (Java Topology Suite) library to handle geographical shapes and the Shapely library to handle the conversion between JTS and Python.

The `toJavaObj` method returns the underlying Java object, which can be used in other parts of the AWIPS system that are written in Java.

The comments at the beginning of the code indicate that this is a base file that is not intended to be overridden. It also provides a history of the software modifications and the associated tickets and engineers.</p>
