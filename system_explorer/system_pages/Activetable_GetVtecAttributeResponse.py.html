                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>The provided code is written in Python and it defines a class named `GetVtecAttributeResponse`. This class has a constructor (`__init__`) and two methods: `getValue` and `setValue`.

The `GetVtecAttributeResponse` class is a simple data holder or a container for a single attribute `value`. 

The `__init__` method is the constructor of the class. When an object of this class is created, this method is automatically called to set the initial state of the object. In this case, it initializes the `value` attribute to `None`.

The `getValue` method is a getter method that returns the current value of the `value` attribute.

The `setValue` method is a setter method that sets the `value` attribute to the value passed as a parameter.

Before the class definition, there is a block of comments that provide information about the software. It mentions that the software was developed and/or modified by Raytheon Company under a specific contract with the US Government. It also contains information about export control and licensing, as well as the contractor's name and address.</p>
