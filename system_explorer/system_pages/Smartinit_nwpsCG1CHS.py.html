                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This Python script appears to be part of a larger software system developed by Raytheon Company. The script is related to a module that calculates surface weather elements from the nwpsCG1 model output.

The first part of the file is a legal disclaimer and copyright notice. It states that the software was developed by Raytheon Company under a specific contract with the US Government. It also mentions that the software contains export-restricted data, and its export or transfer is restricted by U.S. law.

The next section describes the purpose of the file. It is a base file that is not intended to be overridden. However, it can be subclassed to override behavior. It also mentions a specific section of the GFE Online Help for guidance on creating a new smart init.

The script then imports two modules: Init and nwpsCG1.

The main part of the script defines a class called nwpsCG1CHSForecaster, which is a subclass of the nwpsCG1Forecaster class from the nwpsCG1 module. This class has an initializer method that calls the initializer of the superclass with two specific arguments: "nwpsCG1CHS" and "nwpsCG1CHS".

The script also has a main function that creates an instance of the nwpsCG1CHSForecaster class, runs it, and then calls a method named notifyGFE with the argument 'CHS'.

Finally, the script checks if it is being run as a standalone program (as opposed to being imported as a module). If it is, it calls the main function.</p>
