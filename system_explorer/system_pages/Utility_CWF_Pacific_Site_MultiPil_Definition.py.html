                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This code file appears to be a configuration file for a software product developed by Raytheon Company. It sets up product definition overrides for the CWF_Pacific formatter for a specific site. 

The code begins with a header that includes information about the software's development and export control restrictions. It also provides contact information for the contractor, Raytheon Company.

The file then defines a dictionary called "Definition", which is used to store configuration settings for the software. The dictionary is initially empty, and the comment above it instructs users not to make any changes to this part of the file.

The code then provides a series of optional configuration settings, which are commented out. These settings can be uncommented and modified as needed to customize the behavior of the software. 

The settings include various identifiers and flags related to the product's display name, default edit areas, map name for combinations, sub domain UGCs (Universal Geographic Codes), full station ID, WMO ID, product pil, area name, WFO city state, textdbPil, awipsWANPil, and output file. 

There are also optional configuration settings related to the product's database, debug mode, hazard sampling threshold, period combining, use of abbreviations, weather-related flags, river bar zones, area dictionary, language, line length, use of holidays, pass limit, and trace.

The code also includes conditional logic that sets specific subDomainUGCs based on the site and MultiPil values. 

Overall, this code file is used to configure the behavior of a software product based on various settings and conditions.</p>
