                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This Python script appears to be part of a larger system, likely related to weather forecasting or a similar field, given the usage of terms like 'RFD', 'GFDI', 'Curing', etc. These might be specific meteorological terms or specific to the system this script is a part of.

The script defines a class `Procedure` that inherits from `SmartScript.SmartScript`. This class contains two methods: `__init__` and `execute`.

The `__init__` method is the constructor for the class, which is called when an instance of the class is created. It takes `dbss` as an argument and passes it to the parent class's constructor.

The `execute` method appears to be the main function of the class. It takes `timeRange` as an argument and performs a series of operations:

1. It first calculates a time range based on the current time and deletes certain data (like 'RFDmax', 'PERCENTGREEN', 'RFD', 'Curing', 'GFDI') for that time range.

2. Then, it recalculates the time range based on whether the current hour is before or after 15 (3 PM). 

3. It then finds a database named 'ISC', copies certain data from this database for the calculated time range, and creates new data from scratch for the same time range. It also calls a series of 'SmartTools' which might be specific operations or calculations related to the data.

4. Finally, it repeats a similar set of operations for the next day (day 2) for planning purposes.

The script also contains several commented-out lines of code, which might be used for debugging or future enhancements.</p>
