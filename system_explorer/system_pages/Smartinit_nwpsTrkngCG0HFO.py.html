                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This Python script is a part of a software developed or modified by Raytheon Company under a contract with the US Government. It contains export-restricted data and its export/transfer/disclosure is restricted by U.S. law.

The script is a base file that is not intended to be overridden but can be subclassed to override behavior. It provides guidance on creating a new smart initialization for the GFE (Graphical Forecast Editor) as mentioned in the Smart Initialization Configuration section of the GFE Online Help.

The script is specifically for the nwpsTrkngCG0HFO model, which was created by Joe Maloney in 2016. 

The script imports two modules, Init and nwpsTrkngCG0. It then defines a class 'nwpsTrkngCG0HFOForecaster' that inherits from 'nwpsTrkngCG0Forecaster'. The class has an initializer method that takes no arguments and calls the parent class's initializer with "nwpsTrkngCG0HFO" as arguments.

In the main function, an instance of 'nwpsTrkngCG0HFOForecaster' is created, the 'run' and 'notifyGFE' methods are called on this instance. The 'notifyGFE' method is called with 'HFO' as an argument.

The main function is then called if the script is run as a standalone program (not imported as a module).</p>
