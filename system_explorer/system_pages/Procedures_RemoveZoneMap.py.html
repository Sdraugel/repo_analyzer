                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This Python script, named `RemoveZoneMap.py`, is part of a larger software system that is in the public domain. It is designed to remove a specific object from a system or database.

The script imports a module named `SmartScript` and defines a class `Procedure` that inherits from `SmartScript.SmartScript`. The `Procedure` class has an `__init__` method for initialization and an `execute` method.

The `__init__` method is used to initialize the `Procedure` object with a `dbss` parameter, which is passed to the parent class's `__init__` method.

The `execute` method takes three parameters: `editArea`, `timeRange`, and `varDict`. Within this method, two variables `name` and `category` are defined with values "NHCZoneMap" and "ZoneMap" respectively. Then, it calls the `deleteObject` method (presumably from the parent class `SmartScript.SmartScript`) with `name` and `category` as arguments. This suggests that the `execute` method is used to delete a specific object (in this case, an object named "NHCZoneMap" in the category "ZoneMap") from the system or database.

The `MenuItems` list at the top of the script suggests that this script might be part of a larger application with a menu interface, and this script corresponds to the "Edit" option in that menu.

The comments in the code indicate that it has been through a review process and was last updated on May 20, 2020, by an engineer named 'tlefebvr' who addressed some code review comments.</p>
