                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This Python script is part of a software developed by Raytheon Company under a contract with the US government. It contains export-restricted data and can't be disseminated to non-U.S. persons without an export license or other authorization.

The script is a sample to demonstrate the capability of running a batch list of AFOS (Automated Fingerprint Identification Systems) commands through localization. It's not intended to be overridden.

The script imports a module named `BaseTool` and defines a class `ExecuteAFOSCommands` which inherits from `BaseTool.BaseTool`. 

Inside the class, there's a method `process` that takes two arguments: `pythonTextEditorToolCallback` and `arg`. The `arg` is split by commas and for each element in the list, it executes an AFOS command. The result of the command is a list of products. 

For each product, it checks if the product has any content. If it does, it appends the product to a string `rval` followed by a newline character. 

If `rval` is empty after processing all the products, it displays a message saying 'No product in the database matches your request.' 

Finally, it returns `rval`, which is a string containing all the products that have content.</p>
