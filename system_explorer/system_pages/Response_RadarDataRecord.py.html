                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This Python code defines a class named `RadarDataRecord`. The class contains several attributes and corresponding getter and setter methods. 

The attributes of the `RadarDataRecord` class are:

1. `hdf5Data`: This could be data stored in HDF5 format, a hierarchical data format ideal for storing large datasets.
2. `trueElevationAngle`: This could represent the actual angle of elevation.
3. `elevationNumber`: This could represent a unique identifier for a specific elevation.
4. `elevation`: This could represent the height above a given level, especially sea level.
5. `longitude`: This represents the geographical coordinate that specifies the east-west position of a point on the Earth's surface.
6. `latitude`: This represents the geographical coordinate that specifies the north-south position of a point on the Earth's surface.
7. `dataTime`: This could represent the time at which the data was recorded or processed.
8. `volumeCoveragePattern`: This could represent a pattern or method used for covering a volume of space with radar data.

Each attribute has a getter method (e.g., `getHdf5Data()`) that returns the value of the attribute, and a setter method (e.g., `setHdf5Data(hdf5Data)`) that sets the value of the attribute.

The initial part of the code is a comment block that provides information about the software's development, export control, and licensing details. It also includes the software's history and the contractor's details.</p>
