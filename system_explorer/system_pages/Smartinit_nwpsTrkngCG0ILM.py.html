                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This Python code file appears to be part of a larger software system developed by Raytheon Company for the US Government, as indicated by the header comments. The comments also mention that the software contains export-restricted data and requires an export license or other authorization for dissemination to non-U.S. persons.

The code file is a base file that is not intended to be overridden, but can be subclassed to override behavior. It is related to the configuration of a system referred to as GFE, and is specifically related to a "smart init" configuration.

The code defines a Python module that calculates surface weather elements from a model output. The model is referred to as 'nwpsTrkngCG0'. 

The module defines a class `nwpsTrkngCG0ILMForecaster` which is a subclass of `nwpsTrkngCG0Forecaster`. The class has an initializer method that calls the initializer of the parent class with specific parameters.

The `main` function creates an instance of the `nwpsTrkngCG0ILMForecaster` class, runs the forecaster, and then notifies the GFE system with a message 'ILM'.

The last two lines of the code ensure that the `main` function is called when the script is run directly.</p>
