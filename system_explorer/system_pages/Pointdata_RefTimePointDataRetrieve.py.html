                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This Python code file is part of a larger software system developed by Raytheon Company. The code is used for retrieving and organizing point data related to time references. 

The code first imports necessary modules and classes, including PointDataView, PointDataContainer, NoDataException, and PointDataRetrieve. 

The main class defined in this code is `RefTimePointDataRetrieve`, which inherits from the `PointDataRetrieve` class. This class is used to retrieve and organize point data based on time references. It has several methods:

1. `__init__`: This is the constructor method for the class. It initializes the class with several parameters including pluginName, site, parameters, keyId, refTime, constraint, and maxSize.

2. `_query`: This method queries for data based on the parameters and maxSize. It organizes the data and stores it in a PointDataContainer.

3. `__queryRefTimes`: This method queries for reference times from a database using DbQueryRequest and ThriftClient. It returns a list of reference times.

4. `__requestData`: This method requests point data based on available times, parameters, and maxSize. It uses PointDataRequest to make the request and returns the requested data.

5. `_createJarray`: This method creates a Java array of DataTime objects based on available times and maxSize. It returns the created array.

The code also defines a function `retrieve` outside of the class. This function creates an instance of `RefTimePointDataRetrieve` with the given parameters and returns the PointDataContainer from the instance. 

The code has a detailed history of software changes, including the date, ticket number, engineer, and description of each change. 

The code also includes a disclaimer about export control, stating that the software contains export-restricted data and its export/transfer/disclosure is restricted by U.S. law. The contractor's name, address, and contact information are also provided.</p>
