                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This code is part of a software developed by Raytheon Company. The software contains export-restricted data and its export/transfer/disclosure is restricted by U.S. law. 

The code itself is a Python module that provides functionality for serializing and deserializing objects. Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a format that can be stored (for example, in a file or memory buffer) or transmitted (for example, across a network connection link) and reconstructed later (possibly in a different computer environment). Deserialization is the reverse process: taking data structured from some format and rebuilding it into an object.

The module imports several other modules, including `dstypes`, `adapters`, and `DynamicSerializationManager` from the same package.

The code defines a custom exception class `SerializationException` which is used to handle exceptions specifically related to the serialization process.

The `serialize` function takes an object as an argument, creates an instance of `DynamicSerializationManager`, and uses this instance to serialize the object. The serialized object can then be stored or transmitted as needed.

The `deserialize` function takes a series of bytes, creates an instance of `DynamicSerializationManager`, and uses this instance to convert the bytes back into the original object.

The `__all__` variable is an empty list, which means that when this module is imported using `from module import *`, no names will be imported. This is likely a placeholder, to be filled in with the names of functions or classes that should be available when the module is imported in this way.</p>
