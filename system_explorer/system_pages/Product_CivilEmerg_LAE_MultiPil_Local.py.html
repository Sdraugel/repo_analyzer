                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This is a Python script that appears to be part of a larger software system developed by Raytheon Company for the US Government. The script is related to the generation of a Local Area Emergency product. 

The script begins with a detailed comment section that includes information about the software's development, export restrictions, contractor details, and licensing information. It also includes a disclaimer that the software is provided without any warranty or technical support.

The script imports several modules, including `CivilEmerg`, `TextRules`, `string`, `time`, `re`, `os`, `types`, and `copy`. 

The main class in this script is `TextProduct`, which inherits from `CivilEmerg.TextProduct`. This class has a `Definition` dictionary that contains various configuration details for the product, such as its display name, output file, default edit areas, product name, and several product IDs.

The `TextProduct` class has an `__init__` method that calls the `__init__` method of the parent class, and a `_makeProduct` method. The `_makeProduct` method takes four parameters: `fcst`, `editArea`, `areaLabel`, and `argDict`. It appears to append a standard message to the `fcst` string and return it. 

The standard message indicates that the following message is transmitted at the request of a certain source, which is likely defined elsewhere in the larger software system.</p>
