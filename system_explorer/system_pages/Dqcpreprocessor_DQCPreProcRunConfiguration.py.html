                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This Python code defines a class named `DQCPreProcRunConfiguration`. The class has four attributes: `runDate`, `numDays`, `setZero`, and `areas`. All these attributes are initially set to `None`.

The class also includes getter and setter methods for each of these attributes. 

- `getRunDate` and `setRunDate` are used to get and set the value of `runDate` respectively.
- `getNumDays` and `setNumDays` are used to get and set the value of `numDays` respectively.
- `getSetZero` and `setSetZero` are used to get and set the value of `setZero` respectively.
- `getAreas` and `setAreas` are used to get and set the value of `areas` respectively.

The comments at the top of the file indicate that this code was auto-generated and is equivalent to a DynamicSerialize Java class. It also includes information about the software's history, including the date it was generated, the ticket number, the engineer who generated it, and a description.

The comments also include legal information about the software, indicating that it was developed or modified by Raytheon Company under a specific contract with the US Government, and that it contains export-restricted data.</p>
