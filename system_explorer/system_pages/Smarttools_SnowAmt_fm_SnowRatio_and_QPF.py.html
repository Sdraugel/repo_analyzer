                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This code is a part of a software developed by Raytheon Company, and it contains export-restricted data. The software is in the public domain and is provided "as is", without any warranty or technical support.

The main purpose of this code is to compute the amount of snowfall (SnowAmt) by multiplying the SnowRatio with the Quantity of Precipitation Forecast (QPF). The SnowRatio is a local grid created by a smartInit, which applies the Cobb Snow Algorithm.

The code is written in Python and uses the numpy library for numerical computations. It also imports a module named SmartScript.

The code defines a class named Tool which inherits from SmartScript.SmartScript. The class has an `__init__` method for initialization and an `execute` method that performs the main computation.

In the `execute` method, the snowfall is initially calculated as the product of QPF and SnowRatio. Then, if the temperature (T) is greater than 32.0, the snowfall is adjusted using a formula that depends on the temperature. If the temperature is greater than 35.0, the snowfall is set to 0.0. The method returns the calculated snowfall.

The code also mentions that it is an absolute override file, indicating that a higher priority version of the file will completely replace a lower priority version of the file.</p>
