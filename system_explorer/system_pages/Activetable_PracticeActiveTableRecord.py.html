                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This code file appears to be a part of a larger software project developed or modified by Raytheon Company under a contract with the US Government. The software contains export-restricted data, which means it cannot be exported or transferred without proper authorization due to U.S. law.

The actual code in the file is Python. It imports a class named `ActiveTableRecord` from a module in the same directory. Then it defines a new class `PracticeActiveTableRecord` that inherits from `ActiveTableRecord`. 

The `__init__` method is a special method in Python classes, it is the constructor for the class. This method is called when an object is created from the class and it allows the class to initialize the attributes of the class. Here, it's using the `super()` function to call the `__init__` method of the parent class (`ActiveTableRecord`), which means it's initializing the `PracticeActiveTableRecord` instance with the same attributes and methods as an `ActiveTableRecord` instance.

The comments at the top of the file provide some history of the software, including a change made on 05/22/2015 by an engineer named 'randerso' who made the `PracticeActiveTableRecord` class inherit from `ActiveTableRecord`.</p>
