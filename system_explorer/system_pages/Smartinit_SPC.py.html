                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This code is a Python script that is part of a larger software system developed by Raytheon Company. The script appears to be a module that calculates surface weather elements from SPC (Storm Prediction Center) model output. 

The script begins with a disclaimer and licensing information, stating that the software was developed under a specific contract with the US Government and that it contains export-restricted data. The address and contact information for Raytheon Company is also provided.

The script then provides a brief description of its purpose. It is a base file that is not intended to be overridden, but can be subclassed to override behavior.

The script imports everything from the Init module. It then defines a class named `SPCForecaster` that inherits from a parent class named `Forecaster`. The `SPCForecaster` class has a constructor method that initializes it with the name and ID "SPC".

The `SPCForecaster` class also has two methods: `calcSPCDryTstmPrb` and `calcFireWxProb`. Both methods take one argument and return the same argument without any modification. These methods might be placeholders for more complex calculations in a more complete version of the script.

Finally, the script defines a `main` function that creates an instance of the `SPCForecaster` class and runs it. This function would be the entry point of the script if it were run as a standalone program.</p>
