                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>The provided code is a Python script that defines a wrapper class for a PostGIS table. It's designed to interact with a database of geographic features, likely as part of a larger software system developed by Raytheon Company.

The script starts with a header that includes legal and contact information for the Raytheon Company, as well as a brief history of the software's development.

The main part of the script defines a class called `ShapeTable` that inherits from `JUtil.JavaWrapperClass`. This class is used to interact with a PostGIS table, which is a type of database table used for storing and querying geographic objects.

The `ShapeTable` class has several methods:

- `__init__`: Initializes a new instance of the class with a given identifier and sets up some initial values.
- `filename`: Raises a `NotImplementedError`, indicating that this method is obsolete and should not be used.
- `filter`: Sets a filter function for the table, which can be used to filter the data in the table in some way.
- `doFilter`: Applies the filter function to a set of attributes.
- `getEAName`: Gets the name of the edit area, which is a specific part of the geographic data.
- `toJavaObj`: Converts the Python object to a Java object, setting some additional properties on the Java object.
- `__repr__`: Returns a string representation of the object, which in this case is the identifier of the object.

The script also imports several modules at the beginning, which are likely used elsewhere in the larger software system.</p>
