                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This part of the code file is a Python script that provides a function to dynamically load a Python module into memory from a given file. 

The function `loadModule(filename)` takes a filename as input, which is expected to be the fully qualified name of the file. It then extracts the path and the directory from the filename. 

The directory is then added to the beginning of the system path to ensure that the module can be found by Python's import mechanism. 

The `importlib.invalidate_caches()` function is called to ensure that Python's internal list of modules is up-to-date. 

Then, the module name is extracted from the path and the module is imported using `importlib.import_module(modulename)`. 

If the module has already been imported previously, it is reloaded to ensure that any changes to the module are incorporated. 

Finally, the directory is removed from the system path and the loaded module is returned. 

This function is useful in situations where you need to load Python modules dynamically at runtime, for example, in a plugin system. 

The top part of the file contains a legal notice and metadata about the software, including the contractor's name and address, and a reference to a master rights file for licensing information. It also mentions that the software contains export-restricted data and its export/transfer/disclosure is restricted by U.S. law.</p>
