                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This Python script, named LLWSMonitor.py, is a part of a software developed or modified by Raytheon Company. It is a module for monitoring low-level wind shear data. 

The script starts with a detailed header containing information about the software's development, export control, contractor details, and a detailed revision history. The revision history provides a chronological record of the changes made to the script, including the date of the change, the person who made the change, and a brief description of what was changed.

The script then imports required modules and sets up logging. It defines two classes: Monitor and WSinRadar. 

The Monitor class is a child class of MonitorP.Monitor. It has a method named __compare which retrieves low-level wind shear data, processes it, and applies certain rules to the data. If the data is missing, it logs a debug message. 

The WSinRadar class is a child class of MonitorP.Rule. It checks if the wind shear value is below a certain threshold and whether 'llws' is not in the taf. If these conditions are met, it sets a message indicating that the measured low-level wind shear is not in TAF.

Overall, this script appears to be part of a larger system for monitoring and analyzing meteorological data.</p>
