                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This code is part of a Python software developed by Raytheon Company under a contract with the US Government. The software contains export-restricted data, and its dissemination to non-US persons requires an export license or other authorization.

The code file is named `Hazard_MWS_Local.py` and it appears to be related to a Marine Weather Statement (MWS). It's importing a module named `Hazard_MWS_<MultiPil>` and several standard Python libraries such as `string`, `time`, `re` (regular expressions), `os` (operating system), `types`, and `copy`.

The code then defines a class `TextProduct` that inherits from `Hazard_MWS_<MultiPil>.TextProduct`. It makes a deep copy of the `Definition` dictionary from the parent class and modifies the `displayName` key to be "Hazard_MWS_<MultiPil> (Marine Weather Statement)".

There are also some commented out lines of code that suggest optional features, such as an EAS phrase to be included in the product header and a hazard sampling threshold.

The `__init__` method of the class is defined to call the parent class's `__init__` method, ensuring that any initialization code in the parent class gets executed when an object of this class is created.

The comment at the top suggests that this is a base file that is not intended to be overridden, implying that this file provides some core functionality that other parts of the software may rely on.</p>
