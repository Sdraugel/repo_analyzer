                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This Python code defines a class named `TextDBRequest` with a constructor and two methods. The class represents a request to a text database.

The class has one attribute, `message`, which is initialized as `None` in the constructor method `__init__`.

There are two methods in the class:

1. `getMessage`: This method returns the value of the `message` attribute. It's a getter method used to access the value of `message`.

2. `setMessage`: This method takes an argument `message` and sets the `message` attribute of the class to the value of this argument. It's a setter method used to modify the value of `message`.

The top part of the code is a comment block which includes legal information about the software. It mentions that the software was developed and/or modified by Raytheon Company under a specific contract with the US Government. It also states that the software contains export-restricted data, and its export/transfer/disclosure is restricted by U.S. law. The contractor's name, address, and contact information are also provided. It also refers to a "Master Rights File.pdf" for further licensing information. 

The comment just before the class definition indicates that this file was auto-generated against an equivalent DynamicSerialize Java class. This suggests that this Python class is likely part of a system where some components are written in Java and others in Python, and there is a process in place to keep the Python and Java components synchronized.</p>
