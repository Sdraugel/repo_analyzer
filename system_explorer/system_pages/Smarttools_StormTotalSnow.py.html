                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This code is a script for a weather forecasting tool, specifically for calculating the total snowfall during a storm. The tool is developed by Raytheon Company under a US Government contract, and the code contains export-restricted data.

The script is written in Python and uses the numpy and SmartScript libraries. The tool type is numeric and the weather element edited is "StormTotalSnow". The tool is not hidden, as indicated by the variable HideTool set to 0.

The script defines a class named "Tool" that inherits from the SmartScript class. Within this class, there is an initialization method (__init__) and an execute method. The execute method is called once for each grid (a grid here likely refers to a specific geographical area or time range for the weather forecast).

The execute method calculates the total snowfall ("StormTotalSnow") by summing the "SnowAmt" grids over a specified time range ("GridTimeRange"). The result is then returned by the method.

The script also contains a note that it is an absolute override file, meaning that a higher priority version of the file will completely replace a lower priority version of the file.</p>
