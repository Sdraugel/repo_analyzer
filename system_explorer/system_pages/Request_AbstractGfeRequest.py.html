                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>The code is written in Python and it defines an abstract base class named `AbstractGfeRequest` using the `abc` module. 

The `AbstractGfeRequest` class has two instance variables: `siteID` and `workstationID`, both are initialized as `None` in the `__init__` method. This method is decorated with `@abc.abstractmethod`, which means it must be overridden by any concrete (i.e., non-abstract) subclass.

The class also includes getter and setter methods for these two instance variables. The getter methods `getSiteID` and `getWorkstationID` return the values of `siteID` and `workstationID` respectively. The setter methods `setSiteID` and `setWorkstationID` set the values of `siteID` and `workstationID` respectively.

The comments at the top of the file indicate that this software was developed and/or modified by Raytheon Company under a specific contract with the US Government. It also mentions that the software contains export-restricted data, and its export/transfer/disclosure is restricted by U.S. law. The contractor's name, address, and contact information are also provided. 

The file is auto-generated against an equivalent DynamicSerialize Java class, as indicated by the comment.
