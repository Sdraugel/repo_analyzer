                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This code file is part of a software that is in the public domain, which means it is available for use by anyone and does not have any technical support or warranty. The file is named 'CityLocation' and it was created by a GFE Installation Script.

The file appears to be a Python script that is used to manage the location data of cities. It imports a module named 'DefaultCityLocation' and uses a dictionary named 'CityLocation' to store the location data.

The 'CityLocation' dictionary uses the names of cities as keys and tuples of latitude and longitude as values. The dictionary is nested inside another dictionary that uses 'editArea' as a key. The 'editArea' seems to refer to a specific area as defined in another file named 'AreaDictionary'.

This file is also an absolute override file, which means that if there is another version of this file with a higher priority, it will completely replace this version of the file.

In summary, this code file is used to manage city location data and is designed to be completely replaced by a higher priority version if one exists.</p>
