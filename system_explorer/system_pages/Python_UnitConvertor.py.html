                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This Python code defines a class named `UnitConvertor` which is used to convert values between different units of measurement. 

The class has one method, `getConvertMethod`, which takes three arguments: `inUnits` (the units of the input value), `outUnits` (the units to which the value should be converted), and `elementString` (a string representing the type of data being converted, such as "Wind"). 

The `getConvertMethod` method checks the `inUnits` and `outUnits` arguments and assigns a conversion method accordingly. If the input and output units are the same, it assigns the `float` function as the conversion method. If the units are different, it assigns a specific conversion method based on the units. For example, if the input units are "kts" (knots) and the output units are "mph" (miles per hour), it assigns the `ktToMph` method as the conversion method.

The class also defines several conversion methods, each of which takes a value as an argument and returns the value converted to the appropriate units. For example, the `ktToMph` method converts from knots to miles per hour, and the `mphToKt` method converts from miles per hour to knots.

If the `getConvertMethod` method does not recognize the input or output units, it raises a `TypeError`.

The code also contains a header comment with information about the software, including the developer, the contract under which it was developed, export control information, and licensing information.</p>
