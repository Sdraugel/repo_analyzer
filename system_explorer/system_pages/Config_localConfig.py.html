                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This part of the code file appears to be a configuration script for a server, likely related to a product or system developed by Raytheon Company. The script is written in Python.

The initial section is a comment block that provides legal and contractual information about the software, including the fact that it contains export-restricted data. It also provides the contractor's name and address, and refers to a document for further licensing information.

The script then imports a module named `serverConfig` and all of its contents. This module likely contains configuration settings for the server.

The next few lines modify certain settings in the `serverConfig` module:

- `ISC_ROUTING_TABLE_ADDRESS['ANCF']` is set to "http://localhost:8081". This could be the address of a routing table for Inter-System Communication (ISC) on the server.
- `REQUEST_ISC`, `SEND_ISC_ON_SAVE`, and `SEND_ISC_ON_PUBLISH` are all set to 0, which likely disables these ISC-related options.
  
Finally, a dictionary named `SITES` is updated with an entry for 'OAX'. The associated value is a tuple containing various parameters, which could represent geographical coordinates, grid dimensions, timezone, and a grid system (Grid211). This might be the configuration for a site or location that the server interacts with or manages data for.</p>
