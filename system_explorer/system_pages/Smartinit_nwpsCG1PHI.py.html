                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This Python script appears to be part of a larger software system, possibly related to weather forecasting, developed by Raytheon Company under a US Government contract. It contains export-restricted data, meaning it can't be shared outside of the US without proper authorization.

The script defines a class `nwpsCG1PHIForecaster` that inherits from `nwpsCG1Forecaster`, presumably another class defined in the `nwpsCG1` module. The `nwpsCG1PHIForecaster` class has an initializer method that calls the initializer of the parent class with specific arguments.

The `main` function creates an instance of `nwpsCG1PHIForecaster`, calls its `run` method, and then its `notifyGFE` method with the argument 'PHI'.

The script is set up to execute the `main` function if it is run as a standalone program (i.e., not imported as a module in another script).

The comments suggest that this file is a base file that can be subclassed to override behavior, and it is related to a model called 'nwpsCG1PHI'. The 'Smart Init' mentioned in the comments likely refers to a design pattern or specific method used in this software system.</p>
