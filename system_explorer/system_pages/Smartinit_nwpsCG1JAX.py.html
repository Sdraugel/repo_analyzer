                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This code is a Python script that is part of a larger software system developed by Raytheon Company. The script is subject to U.S. export control laws due to the presence of export-restricted data.

The script is a "smart init" file for a model named "nwpsCG1JAX". A "smart init" file is a type of initialization file that can be used to set up a software application in a specific way. In this case, the script is used to initialize a specific model within a larger software system.

The script imports two modules, "Init" and "nwpsCG1". It then defines a new class "nwpsCG1JAXForecaster" which inherits from the "nwpsCG1Forecaster" class defined in the "nwpsCG1" module. The new class has a constructor method that initializes it with the name "nwpsCG1JAX".

The script also defines a main function that creates an instance of the "nwpsCG1JAXForecaster" class, runs the forecaster, and then notifies the GFE (Graphical Forecast Editor) that the 'JAX' model has been run.

Finally, the script checks if it is being run as a standalone program (as opposed to being imported as a module), and if so, it calls the main function. This is a common Python idiom for scripts that can be used both as modules and as standalone programs.</p>
