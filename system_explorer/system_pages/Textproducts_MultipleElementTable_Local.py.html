                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This Python script is part of a software developed by Raytheon Company under a US Government contract. The software contains export-restricted data, and its dissemination to non-US persons, whether in the US or abroad, requires an export license or other authorization.

The script is a local product named MultipleElementTable_Local, which is a type of smart product. It is designed to be customized for different sites by overriding variables, definitions, thresholds, and methods.

The script imports several modules, including MultipleElementTable, string, time, re (regular expressions), os (operating system), types, and copy.

The script defines a class named TextProduct that inherits from MultipleElementTable.TextProduct. It then makes a deep copy of the Definition attribute from the parent class and modifies the "displayName" attribute.

There are several commented out lines of code that seem to be examples of how to customize this class. These include setting the "outputFile", defining "regionList", setting "elementList", changing the "singleValueFormat", and setting "introLetters".

The class also defines an __init__ method, which is a special method in Python classes. This method is called when an instance (or object) of the class is created. Here, it calls the __init__ method of the parent class.</p>
