                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This Python script is a test for the `BundlePainter` module. It appears to be part of a larger software system developed by Raytheon Company, as indicated by the header comments.

The script begins by importing the `BundlePainter` module. It then defines a `main` function which does the following:

1. Prints "Starting" to indicate the start of the function.
2. Imports `DataCubeManagerStarter` from the `com.raytheon.uf.viz.core.datastructure` package. This is likely a custom package from the Raytheon software.
3. Creates an instance of `DataCubeManagerStarter` and calls its `earlyStartup` method.
4. Retrieves the first command-line argument (presumably the name of a data bundle) and assigns it to the variable `bundle`.
5. Creates an instance of `BundlePainter` with the `bundle` name and dimensions of 800.0 by 600.0.
6. Retrieves the data times associated with the `BundlePainter`'s descriptor.
7. For each time in these data times, it calls the `paint` method of the `BundlePainter` instance, takes a screenshot, and saves the screenshot as a PNG file in the '/tmp/images/' directory. The filename of the image is the string representation of the time.
8. Prints "Finished" to indicate the end of the function.

The script then checks if it is being run as a standalone program (as opposed to being imported as a module). If it is, it calls the `main` function.

The `TODO fix` comment suggests that the developer intends to change the output directory for the images in the future.</p>
