                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This code file appears to be a part of a software developed or modified by Raytheon Company under a US Government contract. It contains export-restricted data, and its dissemination to non-US persons, whether in the US or abroad, requires an export license or other authorization.

The software is in the public domain and is provided as is, without technical support and without any warranty. It seems to be related to the AWIPS II system, as indicated by the reference to the AWIPS II Master Rights File for further licensing information.

The code file is named "Patch_Overrides" and it seems to provide patches for text products. It is an absolute override file, meaning that a higher priority version of the file will completely replace a lower priority version of the file.

The code imports several Python modules: string, time, re (regular expressions), os (operating system), types, and copy. It also imports a module named TextRules.

The code defines a class named "Patch_Overrides" with a version "IFPS". The class currently has only an initialization method (__init__) that does nothing (it only contains the "pass" statement). The comments in the code indicate that no changes should be made to this minimum content of the file, and any added methods should be indented inside the class statement.</p>
