                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This is a Python script that is part of a software developed or modified by Raytheon Company under a contract with the US Government. The software contains export-restricted data, and its dissemination to non-US persons requires an export license or other authorization.

The script imports the `execute` function from the `Difference` module and several functions from the `numpy` library. 

The main function in this script is `execute(arg1, arg2)`. This function calculates the difference between two arguments (`arg1` and `arg2`) with some specific conditions. If both arguments are equal to zero, the function returns -128, otherwise, it returns the difference between the two arguments. 

The comment in the code explains that the arguments treat 0 as NaN (Not a Number), so -128 is also treated as NaN. This is done because byte data and NaN don't mix well. 

There's also a software history section in the comments that tracks changes made to the script over time. For example, on August 5, 2015, an engineer named njensen made a change to cast -128 to int8.</p>
