                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This code defines a Python class named `ChangeContextRequest`. The class has two instance variables: `action` and `contextName`, both of which are initialized as `None` in the class constructor (`__init__` method).

The class also includes getter and setter methods for these two instance variables. The getter methods (`getAction` and `getContextName`) return the current values of `action` and `contextName` respectively. The setter methods (`setAction` and `setContextName`) allow you to set the values of `action` and `contextName` respectively.

The comments at the top of the code indicate that this software was developed and/or modified by Raytheon Company under a contract with the US Government. The software contains export-restricted data, and its export/transfer/disclosure is restricted by U.S. law. The contractor's name and address are provided, and there is a reference to a document ("Master Rights File.pdf") for further licensing information.

The comment also mentions that this file was auto-generated against an equivalent DynamicSerialize Java class. This suggests that this Python class is a part of a system that also involves Java components, and the Python class mirrors the structure of a corresponding Java class.</p>
