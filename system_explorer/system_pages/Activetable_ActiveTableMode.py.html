                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This code is written in Python and defines a class named `ActiveTableMode`. The class has two methods: `__init__` and `__str__`.

The `__init__` method is a special method in Python classes, known as a constructor. This method is called when an object is created from the class and it allows the class to initialize the attributes of the class. In this case, it initializes the attribute `value` to `None`.

The `__str__` method is another special method in Python, which returns a string representation of the object. This method is called when we use the `str()` function on an object of this class or when we try to print the object. In this case, it returns the string representation of the `value` attribute.

The comments at the top of the code indicate that this software was developed or modified by Raytheon Company under a specific contract with the US Government. It also mentions that the software contains export-restricted data, and its export/transfer/disclosure is restricted by U.S. law. The contractor's name, address, and contact information are also provided.

There's also a note that this file was generated against an equivalent DynamicSerialize Java class, and a fix was made to the `__str__` method on July 27, 2016.</p>
