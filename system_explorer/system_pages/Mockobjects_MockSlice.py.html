                    <p>This part of the file contains a disclaimer and a Python class definition. 

The disclaimer at the top of the file is a legal notice from Raytheon Company. It states that the software was developed or modified by Raytheon Company under a contract with the US Government. It also mentions that the software contains export-restricted data, which means it's subject to U.S. export laws and regulations. The address and contact information for Raytheon Company is also provided. Lastly, it refers to a document called "AWIPS II Master Rights File.pdf" for further licensing information.

The Python class defined in the code is called `MockSlice`. This class is intended to act as a placeholder for a Java IGridSlice object during unit testing of a file called `HazardUtils.py`. The `MockSlice` class has a single attribute, `validTime`, and a single method, `getValidTime()`. 

The `validTime` attribute is initialized in the constructor method `__init__()` and can be set to any value when an instance of the class is created. If no value is provided during instantiation, `validTime` defaults to `None`.

The `getValidTime()` method is a getter method that returns the current value of the `validTime` attribute.</p>
