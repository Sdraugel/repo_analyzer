                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This part of the code file appears to be a combination of a legal notice, software history, and a small part of Python code.

The legal notice indicates that the software was developed or modified by Raytheon Company under a contract with the US Government. It also mentions that the software contains export-restricted data and its dissemination to non-U.S. persons requires an export license or other authorization.

The software history section provides a record of changes made to the software. In this case, it shows that the initial creation of this part of the software was done by an engineer named 'randerso' on June 22, 2015, under the ticket number 4573.

The Python code at the end is defining what symbols (functions, variables, classes, etc.) should be available when the module is imported with the statement 'from module import *'. In this case, it's making the 'JobProgress' symbol available for import. The last line is importing the 'JobProgress' class from the 'JobProgress' module in the same package.</p>
