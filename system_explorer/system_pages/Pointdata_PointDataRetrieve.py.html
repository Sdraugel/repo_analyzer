                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This Python code is part of a software developed by Raytheon Company under a contract with the US Government. It is a module for requesting point data and is not intended to be overridden. 

The main class in this file is `PointDataRetrieve`, which is used to retrieve point data from a certain plugin, site, and parameters. It includes methods for querying data, building constraints for the query, and organizing the data. 

The `__init__` method initializes the class with several parameters, including plugin name, site, parameters, keyId, refTime, constraint, and maxSize. If no refTime is provided, it will default to the newest time. If the newest data is more than 24 hours old, it will raise a `NoDataException`. If no constraint is provided, an empty dictionary will be assigned. 

The `_query` method is an abstract method that must be implemented by a subclass. It raises a `NoDataException` if not implemented.

The `__queryNewestRefTime` method queries for the newest reference time. If no data is available, it raises a `NoDataException`.

The `_buildConstraints` method builds a dictionary of constraints for the query.

The `_organizeData` method organizes the data into a dictionary where the forecast hour is the key and the point data view is the value.

The code also includes import statements for `NoDataException` and `PointDataView`, which are presumably custom modules or classes used in this software.</p>
