                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This part of the code file is primarily a header that provides legal and contract information about the software. It specifies that the software was developed and/or modified by Raytheon Company under a specific contract with the US Government. It also mentions that the software contains export-restricted data, meaning it cannot be exported/transferred/disclosed without proper authorization under U.S. law.

The contractor's name, address, and contact number are provided, and it is mentioned that further licensing information can be found in the "AWIPS II Master Rights File".

After the header, the code indicates that this file was auto-generated by a tool named PythonFileGenerator.

The "__all__" variable is a list that defines the public interface of the module. It specifies which names should be available when a client imports this module using the "from module import *" syntax. In this case, 'WeatherKey' and 'WeatherSubKey' are specified as the public interface of this module.

The last two lines are importing the 'WeatherKey' and 'WeatherSubKey' modules from the current package (denoted by the dot before the module names). These could be Python files in the same directory as this file.</p>
