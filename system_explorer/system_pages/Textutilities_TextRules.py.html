                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This Python code file, named `TextRules.py`, is part of a software developed and/or modified by Raytheon Company. The software contains export-restricted data and its dissemination is controlled by U.S. law.

The script is a part of a public domain software, provided "as is", without any warranty or technical support. It is authored by a person named Hansen.

The purpose of this script is to provide methods for producing text forecasts from analysis statistics. It is a base file and is not intended to be overridden.

The `TextRules` class is defined in this script, which inherits from several other classes including `ConfigurableIssuance`, `Header`, `TableBuilder`, `SimpleTableUtils`, `CombinedPhrases`, `MarinePhrases`, `FirePhrases`, and `CommonUtils`. The class is initialized by calling the initialization methods of all these parent classes.

The `TextRules` class has several methods defined within it:

1. `IFP`: This method returns 0.
2. `getSiteID`: This method takes a dictionary as an argument and returns the site ID from the "ifpClient" key of the dictionary.
3. `getGFESuiteVersion`: This method returns 0.
4. `fillSpecial`: This method takes a forecast and a dictionary as arguments. It substitutes appropriate strings for special variables in the forecast. It uses several keys from the dictionary to get the required data for substitution.

This script also imports several modules at the beginning, which are likely used in other parts of the `TextRules` class not shown in the provided code.</p>
