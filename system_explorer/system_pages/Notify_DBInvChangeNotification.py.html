                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This Python code defines a class named `DBInvChangeNotification` that extends the `GfeNotification` class. The `DBInvChangeNotification` class is likely used to notify about changes in a database inventory, as suggested by its name.

The class has two instance variables: `additions` and `deletions`, both of which are initially set to `None` in the constructor method `__init__`.

The class provides getter and setter methods for both `additions` and `deletions` variables. The getter methods (`getAdditions` and `getDeletions`) return the current value of the respective variables. The setter methods (`setAdditions` and `setDeletions`) allow setting the value of the respective variables.

The `__str__` method is a special method in Python that returns a string representation of an object. In this case, it returns a string that includes the values of `additions` and `deletions`, each on a new line.

The comments at the top of the code provide information about the software's development history, licensing, and export restrictions. The software was developed and/or modified by Raytheon Company under a contract with the US Government. The software contains export-restricted data, and its export/transfer/disclosure is restricted by U.S. law.</p>
