                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This Python code file is named `UseMetarForPrevailing.py` and it's a part of a software developed or modified by Raytheon Company under a contract with the US Government. It contains export-restricted data and its export/transfer/disclosure is restricted by U.S. law.

The code is mainly about updating Terminal Aerodrome Forecasts (TAFs) using METAR data. METAR is a format for reporting current weather information, while TAFs are weather forecasts for aviation. 

The main function in this code is `updateTafs(bbb, fcsts)`. It takes two arguments, `bbb` and `fcsts`. `bbb` is not used in this function, while `fcsts` is a dictionary of forecasts displayed in the editor window. The function returns a dictionary of modified forecasts.

The function works by iterating over each forecast in `fcsts`, decoding the TAF for each forecast, adjusting the times, retrieving the latest METAR record from the database, updating the TAF with the METAR data, and finally making a new TAF from the updated data. If there are any exceptions during this process, the forecast identifier is added to `badidents` and a warning is logged.

The code also includes a detailed history of revisions and changes, including the date, the engineer who made the change, and a description of the change.</p>
