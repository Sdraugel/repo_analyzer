                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This code is a part of a software developed by Raytheon Company, under contract with the US Government. It is a script written in Python and is used to create an edit area containing points in a specific area (CWA) that, when compared to a neighbor's ISC grids, violate the discrepancy criteria for a particular parameter and point.

The code begins by defining the type of tool being used, the weather element being edited, and the screen list. It then imports necessary modules, including numpy, ISC_Utility_Local, GridInfo, and SmartScript.

The main class, `Tool`, is a subclass of `SmartScript.SmartScript`. It has an `__init__` method for initialization, a `preProcessTool` method, and an `execute` method. The `execute` method is where the main functionality of the tool is implemented. It creates an edit area of discrepant grid points, gets a grid of 0/1 where violating threshold, and sets the edit area equal to points that violated any threshold.

The `execute` method also handles different types of grids (scalar or vector) and provides appropriate error messages if there's no ISC data for the given weather element name. It also provides a status bar message to indicate the end of the tool's execution and the result of the discrepancy check.

The code also contains a detailed history of changes and modifications made to the software over time.

This piece of code is part of a larger Python script. It's using string formatting to create a message that includes a number (num) and a string (WEname). The formatted message is then passed to a method/function called statusBarMsg with two arguments - the formatted message and a string "R".

The statusBarMsg method/function is likely to be a custom function defined elsewhere in the code. It probably updates a status bar in a user interface, displaying the formatted message and applying some kind of action or status indicated by the string "R". 

However, without more context, it's hard to say exactly what the statusBarMsg function does or what "R" stands for. It could be a status code, a color code, or something else entirely.</p>
