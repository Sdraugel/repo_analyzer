                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This Python script is a tool that plots Tropical Wind Hazards found in the VTEC activeTable and plots them in the Hazards grid. 

The script starts by importing necessary modules and classes. It then defines a class `Procedure` which inherits from `SmartScript.SmartScript`. This class has several methods:

1. `__init__`: This is the constructor method that initializes the class instance. It calls the parent class's constructor and also initializes a database session object (`_dbss`).

2. `getActiveTableInfo`: This method retrieves information from the active VTEC table, filtered by a specified list of phenomena (`phenList`). It creates a dictionary (`activeTable`) where each key is a tuple consisting of hazard key, start time, end time, and action, and the value is another dictionary containing the event tracking number (`etn`) and a list of zone IDs (`zoneList`).

3. `askToDeleteHazards`: This method creates a temporary dialog box asking the user whether they want to delete expired hazards. If the user selects "Yes", it deletes the Hazards grid and saves the elements.

4. `execute`: This is the main method that gets executed when the script runs. It initializes the hazard utilities, gets the active table info for a specific list of phenomena, and checks if the active table is empty. If it is, it calls the `askToDeleteHazards` method. If not, it iterates over the active table, retrieves the edit area for each zone, encodes the edit area, creates a time range, and adds the hazard to the Hazards grid.

The script is designed to be used in a meteorological context, specifically for handling and visualizing tropical wind hazards. It was originally created by an engineer named 'lefebvre' and has undergone several updates and revisions.</p>
