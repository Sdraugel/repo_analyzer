                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This Python script is part of a larger software system developed by Raytheon Company. The software is subject to U.S. export control laws due to the sensitive nature of the data it handles. 

The script itself is a module named `Hazard_WSW_Local.py` that is importing another module named `Hazard_WSW_<MultiPil>`. It appears to be a part of a weather-related software, possibly dealing with winter weather products given the `displayName` attribute in the `Definition` dictionary.

The script defines a class `TextProduct` that inherits from `Hazard_WSW_<MultiPil>.TextProduct`. It then creates a deep copy of the `Definition` dictionary from the parent class and modifies the `displayName` attribute.

There are several commented lines in the `Definition` dictionary that suggest optional features that can be included in the product, such as an EAS phrase, a hazard sampling threshold, an overview headline, an overview section, and a setting for accurate cities.

The `__init__` method in the `TextProduct` class is used to initialize instances of the class. It calls the `__init__` method of the parent class to ensure proper initialization.

The script also contains a software history log, which records changes made to the software over time. The most recent entry indicates an update for a "HazSimp format" on March 15, 2020, by an engineer identified as "NFTF".</p>
