                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This code appears to be a part of a larger software system developed by Raytheon Company. It defines a table, named "ElementByPeriod", that provides weather data for a specific area over different time periods. 

The table includes the following weather elements: Sky (percentage of cloud cover), Wind (speed in mph), Temperature, and Precipitation (percentage chance). These elements are calculated or retrieved for different time periods (default is 3 hours per column) and for a specific area chosen by the user.

The table is displayed with a header that includes the name of the area for which the weather data is being displayed. The user has the option to choose the area and the time period at runtime.

The output of this table is saved in a text file named "ElementByPeriod.txt". 

The code also contains a legal disclaimer, stating that the software contains export-restricted data and its export/transfer/disclosure is restricted by U.S. law. It also provides the contractor's name and address.</p>
