                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This code is a Python script that is part of a larger software system developed by Raytheon Company. The script is designed to calculate surface weather elements from the nwpsCG1 model output. 

The script starts with a legal notice and contract information, which states that the software was developed by Raytheon Company under a specific contract with the US Government. It also mentions that the software contains export-restricted data and its dissemination requires an export license or other authorization.

The script then declares that it is a base file that is not intended to be overridden, but can be subclassed to change its behavior. It also mentions a guide for creating a new smart initialization.

The actual code starts with the importation of two modules, `Init` and `nwpsCG1`. It then defines a class `nwpsCG1AJKForecaster` which is a subclass of `nwpsCG1Forecaster` from the `nwpsCG1` module. This class has an initialization method that calls the parent class's initialization method with specific parameters.

The `main` function creates an instance of the `nwpsCG1AJKForecaster` class, runs it, and then notifies the GFE (presumably some other part of the system) with a specific code 'AJK'.

Finally, the script checks if it is being run as the main program (as opposed to being imported as a module), and if so, it calls the `main` function.</p>
