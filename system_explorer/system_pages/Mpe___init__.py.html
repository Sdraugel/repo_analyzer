                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This code file appears to be a Python module that is part of a larger software system developed by Raytheon Company, as per a contract with the US Government. The comments at the top of the file indicate that the software contains export-restricted data, which is subject to U.S. export control laws. This means that the software, or parts of it, cannot be exported or transferred without proper authorization.

The contractor's name, address, and contact number are also provided. There is a reference to a document called "AWIPS II Master Rights File.pdf" which likely contains more detailed licensing information.

The Python code itself is quite minimal. It appears this file was auto-generated by a tool called "PythonFileGenerator". The "__all__" variable is a list that defines the public interface of the module. It specifies which names should be available when the module is imported by another module. In this case, when this module is imported, only 'dqcpreprocessor' will be available for use.</p>
