                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This part of the file appears to be a Python script that defines a class called `OperationalActiveTableRecord`, which inherits from a parent class called `ActiveTableRecord`. 

The script begins with a block of comments that provide information about the software's development, export control, and licensing details. It mentions that the software was developed or modified by Raytheon Company under a contract with the US Government. It also contains export control information, stating that the software contains export-restricted data and its dissemination to non-U.S. persons requires an export license or other authorization.

The comments also provide the contractor's name, address, and contact information. There's a reference to a file named "Master Rights File.pdf" for further licensing information.

The "SOFTWARE HISTORY" section in the comments provides a log of changes made to the software. It lists the date of the change, a ticket number for tracking purposes, the engineer who made the change, and a description of what was changed. In this case, it shows that on 05/22/2015, an engineer named 'randerso' made a change under ticket number 4522, which involved changing the software to inherit from `ActiveTableRecord`.

The actual code starts with an import statement that imports the `ActiveTableRecord` class from the current package (denoted by the dot before `ActiveTableRecord`).

Then, it defines a new class `OperationalActiveTableRecord` that inherits from `ActiveTableRecord`. The `__init__` method is a special method in Python classes, known as a constructor, which is called when an object is created from the class. Here, it's used to initialize the newly created object. The `super` function is used to call a method from the parent class, in this case, the `__init__` method of `ActiveTableRecord`. This means that when an object of `OperationalActiveTableRecord` is created, it will also initialize as an `ActiveTableRecord`.</p>
