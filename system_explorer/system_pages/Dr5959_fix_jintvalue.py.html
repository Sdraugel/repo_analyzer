                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This Python code defines a class named `FixJintvalue` that inherits from `fixer_base.BaseFix` which is a part of the `lib2to3` library. The `lib2to3` library is a tool that helps in converting Python 2.x syntax to Python 3.x syntax. 

The `FixJintvalue` class is used to find and replace instances of the `intValue` method call in the Python code. 

The `PATTERN` attribute is a string that defines the pattern the fixer is looking for in the code. It is looking for instances where the `intValue` method is called with or without parentheses.

The `start_tree` method is called at the beginning of the process for each file that is being processed. It calls the parent class's `start_tree` method with the same arguments.

The `transform` method is where the actual fixing happens. It takes a `node` and `results` as arguments. The `node` is a part of the syntax tree that matches the pattern. The `results` is a dictionary that contains the parts of the `node` that were matched by the pattern. 

If the `base` key is in the `results` dictionary, it clones the `base` node, removes any prefix from the first element of the `base`, and then replaces the `node` in the syntax tree with a call to the `int` function with the `base` as the argument. This effectively changes the `intValue` method call to a call to the `int` function.</p>
