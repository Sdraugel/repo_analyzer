                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This Python code appears to be a testing script for a software product developed by Raytheon Company. The software product is subject to U.S. export control laws, and it seems to be in the public domain, provided without warranty or technical support.

The script is testing different scenarios for a product type called "GLF". It defines a list of scripts, each with different parameters such as commentary, name, product type, command line variables, a combo flag, check strings, and grids to create.

The `testScript` function is the main function that runs these tests. It sets a start time for the grids and a "drtTime" (which might be a specific run time for the test). It then loops through each script in the scripts list, gets the "drtHour" from the script if it exists, and sets the "drtTime" for that script. Then it calls the `generalTestScript` function from the `TestScript` module, passing in the scripts and some default parameters.

The tests appear to be related to forecasting or hazard prediction, as evidenced by the "checkStrings" and "createGrids" fields in the script dictionaries. The "checkStrings" field contains strings that are expected to be found in the output, and "createGrids" field specifies the parameters for creating forecast or hazard grids.</p>
