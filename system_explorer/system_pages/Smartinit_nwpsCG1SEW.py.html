                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This code is written in Python and appears to be part of a larger software system developed by Raytheon Company. The software is subject to U.S. export control laws due to the inclusion of export-restricted data.

The code defines a Python module that calculates surface weather elements from the nwpsCG1 model output. The module contains a class `nwpsCG1SEWForecaster` that is a subclass of `nwpsCG1Forecaster`. The class has an initializer method that calls the parent class's initializer with specific parameters.

The `main` function creates an instance of `nwpsCG1SEWForecaster`, runs the forecaster, and then notifies the GFE (Graphical Forecast Editor) with the 'SEW' message.

The last two lines of the code ensure that the `main` function is called if this script is run as the main program. If it is imported as a module in another script, the `main` function will not be called.

The comments indicate that this file is a base file that is not intended to be overridden, but can be subclassed to change its behavior. It also mentions a "Smart Init" for the nwpsCG1SEW model, suggesting that this code is part of a larger system for weather forecasting.</p>
