                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This Python script appears to be part of a larger software system developed by Raytheon Company. The script is subject to U.S. export control laws and contains contact information for the contractor.

The script defines a class called `ETSSForecaster` that inherits from a base class called `Forecaster`. The `ETSSForecaster` class is initialized with the name "ETSS".

The `ETSSForecaster` class has two methods: `calcStormSurge` and `calcSurgeTide`. Both methods take a single argument and return the argument divided by 0.3048. This division operation is likely converting the input from one unit of measurement to another (for example, from meters to feet, as 1 meter is approximately 0.3048 feet).

The script also defines a `main` function that creates an instance of `ETSSForecaster` and calls its `run` method. If the script is run as the main program (i.e., not imported as a module), the `main` function is called. 

In summary, this script is part of a larger system and provides functionality related to forecasting, possibly in the context of storm surge or tide prediction.</p>
