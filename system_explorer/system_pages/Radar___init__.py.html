                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This part of the code file is primarily a legal notice and metadata about the software and its generation.

The first section is a legal notice from Raytheon Company, the developer of the software. It states that the software was developed under a specific contract with the US Government and contains export-restricted data. The export, transfer, or disclosure of this data is restricted by U.S. law, and dissemination to non-U.S. persons, whether in the United States or abroad, requires an export license or other authorization. The contractor's name, address, and contact information are also provided.

The second section refers to a document called the "AWIPS II Master Rights File" for further licensing information.

The third section indicates that the file was auto-generated by a tool called PythonFileGenerator.

The last part of the code is a Python statement that defines the public interface of a Python module. The `__all__` variable is a list that defines the public interface of the module. It specifies which names should be available when a client imports the module using the `from module import *` syntax. In this case, 'request' and 'response' are the names that will be imported when this module is imported using the `from module import *` syntax.</p>
