                <h2>TextFormatter.py</h2>
                <div class="description">
                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This is a Python script named `TextFormatter.py` developed by Raytheon Company. The script seems to be part of a larger software package, possibly related to weather forecasting given the terminology used in the code.

The script starts with a detailed header that includes legal and export control information, the contractor's details, and a software history log that tracks changes made to the code over time.

The script then imports several modules and defines a class named `TextFormatter`. The class has an initializer method (`__init__`) that sets up several instance variables including a data manager, an IFP client, and a logger. 

The `getForecast` method is defined within the `TextFormatter` class. This method seems to be responsible for creating a forecast. It takes in a forecast name and a dictionary of arguments, and performs several operations including retrieving the forecast definition, setting up runtime variables, and performing sanity checks. If the forecast type is a "component", it prepares to create a narrative of one forecast.

The script also contains several commented-out lines of code, which are not currently being executed but were possibly used for debugging or are being saved for potential future use. 

The code is well-structured and includes error handling to raise exceptions when certain conditions are not met.

This code is part of a larger program that generates different types of forecasts, specifically table forecasts, narrative phrase forecasts, and smart text forecasts. 

The `__createNarrativeDef` function creates a dictionary with a method list and a narrative definition, which includes the forecast name and the duration of the time range.

The `__loop` function loops through the product by edit areas and time ranges. It creates a text forecast based on the edit areas and time ranges. If an exception occurs during the generation of the forecast, it logs the error and raises the exception.

For each forecast type, the code creates an instance of the corresponding class (ForecastTable, ForecastNarrative, or TextProduct), sets some initial values, and then attempts to generate a forecast. If an exception occurs during this process, it logs the error and re-raises the exception.

For the "smart" forecast type, there is additional handling for a test mode, translation into different languages, and conversion to upper case. If the forecast type is not recognized, it logs an error and raises an exception.

Finally, the code deletes all temporary reference data and returns the text of the forecast.

This Python code is part of a larger system that generates forecasts. The code is divided into two main parts:

1. The first part is responsible for generating a forecast text. It takes an argument dictionary `argDict` and a `forecastDef` object as input. It tries to generate a forecast using the `generateForecast` method of the `forecast` object, using the `argDict` as arguments. If an exception occurs during this process, it logs the error and re-raises the exception. The generated forecast text is then appended to an existing `text` string. The `fillSpecial` method of the `forecast` object is then used to replace specific placeholders in the `text` string with values from the `argDict`.

2. The second part is a method named `__getRunTimeVariables`. This method is responsible for setting up runtime variables for the forecast. It takes a forecast name, a `forecastDef` object, a forecast type, a module, and an `argDict` as input. It first tries to get the values of certain variables from `argDict` and `varDict` (which is a part of `argDict`). If these values are not found, it sets them to default values. It then converts certain values to integers. It also sets up edit areas and time ranges for the forecast. It tries to get the edit areas from various sources, including the command line, the `generateForecast` command, and a combinations file. If the combinations file cannot be loaded after several attempts, it logs an error and returns a string indicating that the combinations file could not be loaded.

This Python code is part of a larger system that appears to be related to weather forecasting and hazard detection. Here's a breakdown of what it does:

1. It checks if there are any edit areas defined in a data frame `dfEditAreas`. If there are, it processes each area and label pair. If the area is a tuple, it creates a reference data for the area. If the area is not a tuple, it tries to get the reference data for the named area. If the reference data is not found, it returns an error message. All reference data are stored in `refDataList`.

2. It sets up a HazardsTable if the forecast type is "smart". It tries to get the allowed hazards and the filter method from the product. If these are not available, it sets `allowedHazards` to None.

3. If there are allowed hazards, it sets up edit areas as a list of combinations. It processes each area and label pair in `dfEditAreas` again. If the area is a list or a tuple, it appends the area or the area name to `editAreas`. If the area is neither, it appends the area to `editAreas`.

4. If the product definition has 'separateByTimeZone' set to "effectiveTZ" or "actualTZ", it changes the set of edit areas to ensure that time zones are the same in each grouping.

5. If the product definition has 'accurateCities' set to 1, it gets the city location from the product definition and checks if each edit area is in the city location dictionary. If an edit area is not in the dictionary, it logs an error message. For each city in the edit area, it creates a reference data and appends it to `cityRefData`.

6. It gets the Product ID and other information for the HazardsTable, imports the HazardsTable module, and creates a HazardsTable object with several parameters.

7. It stores the HazardsTable object in `argDict["hazards"]` for later use.

8. If the edit area type is "Combinations", it reorganizes the combinations.

This code seems to be part of a larger system for weather forecasting and hazard detection. It's responsible for setting up and managing reference data for different geographical areas (edit areas), handling hazard information, and managing city-specific data.

This Python code is performing a series of operations related to hazard areas, time ranges, and other variables for a weather forecasting application. Here's a breakdown of what each section does:

1. The first part of the code is checking if the `reorganizeCombos` variable is set. If it is, it retrieves hazard area combinations and reassigns them to `dfEditAreas`.

2. The next section checks if the `editAreaType` is set to "Combinations". If it is, it calls the `getCombinations` method to get combinations of edit areas and assigns them to `argDict["editAreas"]` and `dfEditAreas`.

3. The following section sets up time ranges. It checks different sources for time ranges and assigns them to `dfRanges`. If `argDict["useRawTR"]` is set to 1, it appends the time range and its name to `rawRanges`. If `dfRanges` is not empty, it gets the time range for each range name in `dfRanges` and appends it to `rawRanges`.

4. The code then sets the row label based on the `rowVariable` value. The row label is used as a heading in `argDict`.

5. The `__pairAreaWithLabel` method pairs chosen edit areas with associated labels from a default list and returns a new list.

6. The `__createArea` method creates a ReferenceData for a given latitude, longitude, and dimension. If the dimension is not zero, it creates an edit area of one grid point closest to the latitude/longitude value.

7. The `__getLatLonAreaName` method generates a name for an area based on its latitude, longitude, and dimension.

8. The `getCombinations` method retrieves combinations of edit areas. For each combination, it gets the edit area and assigns it to `newArea`. If the edit area is the first one in the combination, it generates a label for it and creates a new ReferenceID.

This code seems to be part of a larger system, possibly related to geographical data management or weather forecasting. Here's a breakdown of what each part does:

1. `oc()`: This seems to be a function call, but without the definition or context, it's hard to determine what it does.

2. `getComboNumber()`: This method increments the `__comboNumber` attribute by 1 and returns the new value.

3. `getFcstDef(self, fcstName, argDict)`: This method attempts to find a forecast definition by name. It first tries to find a method with the given name in the current forecast "TextProduct" class. If it doesn't find it, it looks for the forecast name in imported modules, and if it still doesn't find it, it tries to find a module with that name. If it finds the forecast definition, it sets it in the `argDict` and returns 1 and the module. If it doesn't find it, it returns 0 and the module.

4. `assembleChildWords(self, tree, node)`: This method concatenates the "words" attribute of all children of a given node and sets the result as the "words" attribute of the node.

5. `unionAreas(self, name, area1, area2)`: This method performs a logical OR operation on two areas (presumably geographical areas represented as `ReferenceData` objects) and returns a new `ReferenceData` object.

6. `getEditArea(self, editAreaName, argDict)`: This method returns a `ReferenceData` object given an edit area name. It seems to be interacting with a system called GFE (possibly the Graphical Forecast Editor from the National Weather Service). It also applies a suffix to the edit area name if one is specified in the forecast definition.

7. `_separateByTimeZone(self, editArea`: This is an incomplete method definition. It seems like it would separate data by time zone, but without the full method, it's impossible to say for sure.

The commented-out lines of code and notes suggest that this code is in the process of being updated or refactored.

The provided code is written in Python and contains several functions. Here's a brief summary of what each function does:

1. `separateByTimeZone`: This function takes a list of areas and separates them into groups based on their time zones. It uses the `AreaDictionary` to get the time zone for each area. If an area is not found in the `AreaDictionary`, it uses the default time zone. The function returns a list of groups where each group contains areas with the same time zone.

2. `makeSquare`: This function takes a latitude, longitude, and a distance in kilometers. It calculates the coordinates of a square around the given point with the given distance as the side length. It returns a list of these coordinates.

3. `makePoint`: This function takes a string in the format "x,y" and returns a `Coordinate` object with the given x and y values.

4. `makeArea`: This function takes a grid location, a list of points, and an optional reference name. It creates a polygon from the list of points and returns a `ReferenceData` object with the given grid location, a unique reference ID, the polygon, and the coordinate type as LATLON.

5. `storeReferenceData`: This function takes a reference set manager and reference data. It saves the reference data using the reference set manager. If the reference data is temporary, it saves its ID to delete later.

6. `deleteAllTempReferenceData`: This function takes a reference set manager and deletes all temporary reference data from the server.

7. `getTime`: This function returns the current time as a string without spaces or colons.

8. `getAbsTime`: This function takes a string in the format "YYYYMMDD_HHMM" and returns an `AbsTime` object with the given year, month, day, hour, and minute.

9. `usage`: This function prints the usage instructions for a command-line tool. The tool takes several command-line arguments including database, forecast type, output file, server output file, host, port, and language.

This Python code has two main functions: `writeToFile` and `writeToServerFile`. 

The `writeToFile` function writes forecast data to a specified file. It takes three arguments: `forecasts`, `outputFile`, and `mode`. `forecasts` is presumably a string containing forecast data, `outputFile` is the path to the file where the data will be written, and `mode` is the mode in which the file is opened (e.g., 'w' for write, 'a' for append). If `outputFile` is not None or an empty string, the function opens the file in the specified mode, changes the file permissions to 644 (read and write permissions for the owner, and read permissions for the group and others), and writes the forecast data to the file. If the file cannot be opened, the function returns 0; otherwise, it returns 1.

The `writeToServerFile` function also writes forecast data to a file, but this file is located on a server. It takes three arguments: `forecasts`, `outputFile`, and `ifpClient`. `forecasts` and `outputFile` have the same roles as in the `writeToFile` function, and `ifpClient` is presumably an object that allows interaction with the server. If `outputFile` is not None or an empty string, the function creates a TextFileID with the name of the output file and the string "PRODGEN", creates a TextFile with this ID and the forecast data, and saves this TextFile to the server using the `ifpClient`. The function always returns 1, regardless of whether `outputFile` is None or an empty string.

The code at the beginning of the provided snippet seems to be a part of a larger command-line interface, providing options for the user to specify parameters such as language, time format, product type, and more. However, without the rest of the code, it's hard to say exactly how these options are used.</p>
