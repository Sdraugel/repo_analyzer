                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This Python script is a configuration file for a software developed by Raytheon Company. It is related to the GFE (Graphical Forecast Editor) used for editing topographical data for a Standard Terrain initiative. 

The script starts with a legal disclaimer and information about the software's development and export restrictions. It also provides a brief history of the software's updates.

The script then defines some configuration settings for the GFE. Here are some key points:

1. The script imports all configuration settings from `gfeConfig`, a base configuration file. 

2. It sets `HideConfigFile` to 1, which likely means this configuration file should be hidden from users.

3. It sets `DefaultGroup` to "NewTerrain", which might be the default group of settings or data to be used.

4. It defines `mutableModel` as "EditTopo_NewTerrain", which could be the model that can be edited using this configuration.

5. It defines `dbTypes` as ["EditTopo", "", "D2D"], which are likely the types of databases that can be used or edited.

6. It turns off the split boundary display for performance reasons, as these grids have a 1-second resolution.

7. It defines color tables for different types of topographical data.

8. It sets the order in which grids are managed by the Grid Manager.

9. It sets the layout of the Grid Manager's Topography Editor to "OnLeft".

This script is designed to be used when starting the GFE, and it will bring up a special GFE with just the Topo parameters.</p>
