                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This Python script is a part of a larger software developed by Raytheon Company. It is a local override for the ISC_Utility module, allowing for local modifications to the configuration and routines of the ISC_Utility module.

The script begins with importing necessary modules: ISC_Utility, numpy, SmartScript, and time.

It then defines a class, ISC_Utility_Local, which inherits from the ISC_Utility class in the ISC_Utility module. The class has an initializer method that takes four arguments: dbss, eaMgr, mdMode (with a default value of None), and toolType (with a default value of "numeric"). This method calls the initializer of the parent class with the first three arguments.

The class also has a method named configuration. This method sets several configuration variables, including:

- MAXTOPODIFF: The maximum elevation difference (in feet) for points to be considered in ISC statistics.
- LANDEDITAREA: The name of an EditArea that contains just land points. If not overridden, the code will calculate the land area by a 'union' of all points found in the CWA editareas.
- MultiParms: A dictionary that maps a parameter to a tuple of other parameters. This is used for checking multiple parameters.
- MINPOINTS: The minimum number of points along a border before it considers a failing average threshold "significant".
- DEFAULT_THRESHOLD and THRESHOLDS: These are used to set thresholds for different parameters.

The comments in the code provide detailed explanations about these variables and how they are used in the software.

This code is a part of a configuration section in a Python program. It defines a list of tuples where each tuple represents a configuration for a specific parameter or a set of parameters. 

Each tuple in the list contains:
- A tuple of parameter names. For example, ("nsWindSpd","WindGust") are the parameters for the first configuration.
- A tuple defining the type of the parameter, its value, and some additional settings. For example, ("graduated",(15,(20,10)),("greater_equal",12,0),0) is the configuration for the first set of parameters. Here, "graduated" might be indicating the type of the parameter, (15,(20,10)) could be the values or thresholds for the parameters, ("greater_equal",12,0) might be a condition to be met by the parameters, and 0 could be an additional setting or flag.

The exact meaning and usage of these configurations would depend on the rest of the program where these configurations are used. 

The comment at the end of the code indicates that this is the end of the configuration section.</p>
