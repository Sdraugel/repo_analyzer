                    <p>The provided code is not actually executable code, but rather a combination of a software license agreement and a module description.

The first part of the text is a legal disclaimer and license agreement from Raytheon Company. It states that the software was developed or modified under a specific contract with the U.S. Government. It also mentions that the software contains export-restricted data, which means it cannot be exported or transferred without proper authorization under U.S. law. The contractor's name, address, and contact number are also provided. It refers to a document named "AWIPS II Master Rights File.pdf" for further licensing information.

The last part of the text is a docstring, which is a comment that describes what the following code does. In this case, it indicates that the subsequent code contains the modules implementing the textdb Command Line Interface (CLI) tool. This tool is likely used for interacting with a text database.</p>
