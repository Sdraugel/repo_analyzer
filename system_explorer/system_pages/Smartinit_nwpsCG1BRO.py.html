                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This Python script is a part of a larger software developed by Raytheon Company. The software is export-controlled, meaning it contains data that is restricted by U.S. law and cannot be exported or transferred without an export license or other authorization.

The script defines a class `nwpsCG1BROForecaster` that inherits from the `nwpsCG1Forecaster` class. This class is used to calculate surface weather elements from the `nwpsCG1` model output. The class has an `__init__` method that initializes the class with the model name "nwpsCG1BRO".

The `main` function creates an instance of the `nwpsCG1BROForecaster` class, runs the forecaster, and then notifies the GFE (Graphical Forecast Editor) with the string 'BRO'.

If this script is run as the main program (not imported as a module), the `main` function is called.

The comments indicate that this is a base file that is not intended to be overridden, but it can be subclassed to override behavior. It also mentions that this file is related to a "Smart Init" for the `nwpsCG1BRO` model, which was created by Joe Maloney on 2016-07-18.</p>
