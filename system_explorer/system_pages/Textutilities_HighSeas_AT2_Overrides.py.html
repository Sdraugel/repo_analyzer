                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This Python code is part of a software that is in the public domain and is provided without any warranty or technical support. The software is named HighSeas_AT2_Overrides and was initially created by an author named Thomas LeFebvre.

The code imports several modules, including HighSeas_AT2, string, time, re, os, types, copy, TextRules, SampleAnalysis, and ForecastNarrative, UserInfo.

The code then defines a class named HighSeas_AT2_Overrides. Inside this class, there are two __init__ methods. The first __init__ method is empty and the comment above it instructs not to make any changes to it.

The second __init__ method is a constructor that initializes instances of the TextRules and SampleAnalysis classes when an instance of the HighSeas_AT2_Overrides class is created.

There is also a commented-out method called _Text2. If uncommented, this method would return a string describing a specific geographic region. The comment above it indicates that it is a required override, which suggests that it is intended to be overridden in a subclass or an instance of the class.</p>
