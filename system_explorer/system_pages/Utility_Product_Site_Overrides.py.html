                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This code file appears to be a template for creating specific overrides for a product at a given site. The file is provided by Raytheon Company and is subject to U.S. export control laws. 

The file begins with a disclaimer and information about the contractor. It then specifies that it is a base file not intended to be overridden and is in the public domain. 

The file imports several Python modules: string, time, re (regular expressions), os (operating system), types, and copy, as well as two custom modules: TextRules and SampleAnalysis.

A class is defined with the name `<product>_<site>_Overrides`. This class is intended to be used as a template for creating specific overrides for a product at a given site. The class currently has only an `__init__` method, which is empty.

The code also contains instructions on how to add methods to the class and how to override a dictionary from the TextRules module. An example of such an override is provided. 

The comments in the code suggest that no changes should be made to the base class definition and the `__init__` method, and that methods should be indented inside the class statement. It also suggests adding a debug statement at the beginning of each method for troubleshooting purposes.</p>
