                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>The provided code appears to be part of a weather forecasting software developed or modified by Raytheon Company. The software is subject to U.S. export control laws and the details of the contractor are provided.

The software is in the public domain and is provided "as is", without any warranty or technical support. It seems to be a tool named "MaxRH_Tool", but the author's name is not specified.

The tool is a numeric type and it edits the "MaxRH" weather element. It uses the numpy library, which is a library for the Python programming language adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

The tool is set up as a class that inherits from the SmartScript class. The class has an initialization method that takes in a database session (dbss) and a method named "execute" that takes in a GridTimeRange. The "execute" method returns the maximum relative humidity (RH) over the selected time range.

The code also mentions an absolute override file, indicating that a higher priority version of the file will completely replace a lower priority version of the file.</p>
