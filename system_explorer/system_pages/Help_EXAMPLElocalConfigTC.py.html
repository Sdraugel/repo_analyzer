                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This Python script appears to be a configuration file for a weather forecasting software developed by Raytheon Company. It is part of a larger system, possibly called AWIPS II, as indicated by the reference to the "AWIPS II Master Rights File".

The script begins with a legal notice, stating that the software was developed or modified by Raytheon Company under a specific contract with the US Government. It also mentions that the software contains export-restricted data, and its export or transfer is restricted by US law.

The script then provides the contractor's name and address, which is Raytheon Company located in Omaha, Nebraska.

The actual code starts with importing all the contents of a module named 'serverConfig'. This module presumably contains various configurations for the server.

The script then defines a new time constraint 'LT4', which seems to be a time interval of 4 hours starting from midnight local time. This is done using a function 'localTC' which likely comes from the 'serverConfig' module.

Next, it defines a new weather element called 'Clearing'. This is done using a tuple 'elem1' which contains the name of the element, its type (SCALAR), its abbreviation ('pot'), its full name ('Clearing Potential'), and some numerical values which could be default or limit values for this element.

Finally, the script creates a list 'parms' which contains a tuple. The tuple includes the newly defined weather element 'elem1' and the time constraint 'LT4'. This list might be used elsewhere in the software to apply the new weather element with its time constraint.</p>
