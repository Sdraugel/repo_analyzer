                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This code is a part of a larger software system developed by Raytheon Company, which is a U.S. defense contractor. This particular script is related to the production of a "911 Telephone Outage Emergency" alert.

The script begins with a detailed comment section that includes information about the software's development, export restrictions, contractor details, and licensing information. It also mentions that the software is in the public domain and is provided without warranty.

The script then imports several modules, including CivilEmerg, TextRules, and several standard Python libraries. 

The main class in this script, TextProduct, is a subclass of the TextProduct class from the CivilEmerg module. It defines several properties related to the product, such as its display name, output file, default edit areas, product name, and various IDs. 

The class has two methods: __init__ and _makeProduct. The __init__ method is the constructor that initializes the class, and it calls the constructor of the superclass (CivilEmerg.TextProduct).

The _makeProduct method is used to create the product (in this case, a message for a 911 Telephone Outage Emergency). It takes four parameters: fcst, editArea, areaLabel, and argDict. The method appends a standard message to the 'fcst' string, indicating that the message is transmitted at the request of a certain source.

Overall, this script appears to be part of a system for generating and managing emergency alerts.</p>
