                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>The code file is a Python script named LLWSData.py, developed by Raytheon Company under a contract with the US Government. The script is part of a software that is subject to U.S. export control laws. 

The script contains a series of functions that handle data related to Low-Level Wind Shear (LLWS), a phenomenon that can be dangerous for aircraft. The functions are:

1. `readLLWS(ident)`: This function reads LLWS data from a file. The file path is constructed using the 'ident' parameter. The data is read line by line, split into different variables, and stored in a dictionary. If the file cannot be accessed or the data cannot be parsed, the function logs an appropriate message and returns an empty dictionary.

2. `writeLLWS(ident, data)`: This function writes LLWS data to a file. The file path is constructed using the 'ident' parameter. The data is written line by line. If the file cannot be written, the function logs an error message.

3. `retrieve(siteID, info)`: This function retrieves METAR data (a type of weather report used in aviation) for a given site. It processes the METAR data and ACARS data (aircraft communication addressing and reporting system data), generates shear data, and stores it in a dictionary. If no METAR data is available, the function raises an exception. If there is no ACARS data, the function logs a debug message. The function also processes radar data and generates shear data for each radar in 'radars'.

The script imports several modules and creates a logger for logging messages. It also defines several constants related to time calculations.</p>
