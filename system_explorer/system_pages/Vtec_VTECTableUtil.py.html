                <div class="description">
                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>The code provided is a Python script that is part of a larger software developed by Raytheon Company. It contains a class named `VTECTableUtil` that provides various utility functions for handling and manipulating VTEC (Volatile Tornado Emission Control) tables. 

Here are some of the key functionalities provided by the `VTECTableUtil` class:

1. `__init__`: This is the constructor of the class. It initializes the class with an active table filename and sets up a lock file for the active table.

2. `consolidateByID`: This function consolidates records in a given table based on their ID. It takes a table and a list of fields to compare as input, and returns a consolidated table where identical hazards are merged into a single record with multiple ID entries.

3. `printActiveTable`: This function pretty-prints the given table or table entry. It has options to combine records and to specify the ID type (zone or city).

4. `printEntry`: This function pretty-prints an entry in the table. It formats various fields of the entry for better readability.

The script also imports several Python modules and Java classes at the beginning, which are used throughout the script. 

The comments at the beginning of the script provide some background information about the software, including its developer, licensing information, and a brief history of the software's development. It also mentions that the file is not intended to be overridden, suggesting that it provides some core functionality that should remain consistent across different uses of the software.

The provided code seems to be a part of a larger Python script that is dealing with some form of data entries, possibly related to weather or climate data (as suggested by terms like 'phen', 'sig', 'vtec', 'zone', etc.). 

The main functionalities of this code are:

1. Formatting and printing entries: The code contains methods that format and print entries in a specific way. These methods check if certain keys exist in the entry dictionary and format the values accordingly. If the keys don't exist, default values are used. The keys include 'phensig', 'previousStart', 'previousEnd', 'purgeTime', 'issueTime', 'state', 'downgradeFrom', 'upgradeFrom', etc.

2. Comparing hazard entries: The `hazardCompare` method compares two hazard entries based on provided fields. If both entries have the same value for all the provided fields, the method returns 1, indicating that the entries are equal.

3. Saving the old active table: The `saveOldActiveTable` method saves the old active table and timestamps it. It creates a backup directory if it doesn't exist, and saves the old active table in a gzip file. The filename of the gzip file is a combination of the current date and time, and the basename of the active table filename.

4. Getting 4-letter site ID: The `_get4ID` method seems to get a 4-letter site ID from a SiteMap instance.

5. The code also seems to be dealing with some sort of time data, as it frequently converts certain values to time using the `time.asctime(time.gmtime())` function.

This code is written in Python and it appears to be part of a larger system that deals with managing and backing up tables of data. 

The first part of the code defines a method `purgeOldSavedTables(self, purgeTime)`. This method purges or removes old saved tables. It calculates a purge time, identifies the directory and files to be purged, and then deletes files older than the purge time. If there's an issue with removing a file, it logs the problem.

The second method, `_convertTableToPurePython(self, table, siteId)`, converts a table to a Python-friendly format. It seems to be working with Java objects, converting them into Python objects.

The last function, `backupActiveTable(activeTable, activeTableMode, filePath, siteId)`, appears to backup an active table. It creates a Python list of the active table records, creates a utility object with the file path of the active table, converts the active table to a Python-friendly format, and then saves the old active table.

The code uses several external modules and methods such as `os`, `glob`, `time`, `stat`, `LogStream`, `ArrayList`, `ActiveTableUtil`, `JUtil`, `ActiveTableRecord`, and `VTECTableUtil`, which are not defined in the provided code snippet. These are likely imported from other files or libraries in the larger system.</p>
