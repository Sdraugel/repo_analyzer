                    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                    <p>This code file appears to be part of a software developed or modified by Raytheon Company under a contract with the US Government. The software contains export-restricted data, meaning its export/transfer/disclosure is restricted by U.S. law.

The actual code starts with the import of a module named `SmartScript`.

Then, a class named `Common` is defined, which inherits from `SmartScript.SmartScript`. This class has an initialization method (`__init__`) that takes an argument `dbss` and passes it to the initialization method of the parent class.

The class also includes a method named `_convertFtToM` that takes a value as an argument, prints a message "Using Utility Version of convertFtToM", and returns the value divided by 3.28084. This method appears to be a utility function for converting feet to meters (since 1 foot is approximately 3.28084 meters). The underscore at the beginning of the method name suggests that it's intended to be a private method, meaning it should not be accessed directly outside of the class.</p>
